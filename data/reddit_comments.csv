comment,cars,1ntl2pt,Ford’s CEO isn’t impressed with Apple CarPlay Ultra,,"Except, they're kind of in it together. There's a reason Google pays Apple Billions a year, to make sure that Google stays as the default search app on iPhones.

*Google paid Apple approximately $20 billion in 2022 to remain the default search engine on Apple's Safari browser, and this figure has been cited in a Department of Justice antitrust case against Google. The payment represents nearly half of Google's total search traffic and is a significant portion of Apple's Services revenue.* ([SOURCE](https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/05/06/googles-default-search-payments-to-apple-at-risk-in-antitrust-lawsuit))

So, while Apple touts that they don't sell your data, they are more than happy to take payment for access to it, from Google. So, how innocent are they really? I mean, they are literally profiting off of your private data. They're just letting someone else do the dirty work of collecting it.",https://www.theverge.com/transportation/786376/ford-jim-farley-apple-carplay-ultra-decoder

comment,SUVIndia,1hd9vnv,Black Beast Tata Harrier !! ,,"Where are the chapri mods? 
Black ‘beast’!! 
Harrier is a Tata product, tail lights clearly ‘inspired’ from previous gen BMWs. Is very unreliable and the horror ASC stories plague the internet. At 170bhp, FWD 1.8 tons this is hardly a beast.

It’s undoubtedly a good looking decent Indian family crossover.",https://i.redd.it/fdol7w8fll6e1.jpeg

So if you’re not gonna take it off-road and are secure enough in your manhood then please opt for the XUV700 or a Safari/Harrier.",https://i.redd.it/tnm14k0w973e1.jpeg
comment,CarsIndia,1nx1g79,Car sales september 2025,,"2019 Harrier owner here. No issue faced till date. But yes, service has had ups and downs",https://i.redd.it/efpka4y6vwsf1.jpeg
comment,CarsIndia,1nx1g79,Car sales september 2025,,"Nah, they don't break down more, they just get talked about more. Tata's got some QC problems and little issues in all their cars, but the big breakdowns usually happen with the Harrier or Safari. I bet like 70-80% of the Tata problems you see online are about those. Breakdowns are pretty rare in the Nexon or other cars.

Service isn't amazing, and it's always a letdown when people start comparing. Tata service centers don't really care about the small stuff. They're good as long as the engine's running and the car's moving. They don't pay attention to the details.",https://i.redd.it/efpka4y6vwsf1.jpeg
comment,CarsIndia,1nwxm8y,Best VFM car in the country!,"Test drove the Citroën Aircross a month back and honestly it’s way out of its league. The comfort is next level — suspension just glides over bad roads, seats are super supportive, and the torque delivery feels almost diesel-like for easy overtakes. Today they launched the new Aircross X variant starting at ₹8.29L, which adds ventilated seats, 360° camera, wireless charging, leatherette dash, ambient lighting and more. With the recent price cuts + 5-star Bharat NCAP rating, this thing is hands down the most VFM SUV in the country right now.","We could have been interested if they had kept c5 aircross in the price range of harrier, they failed there and then rest is story. 
Looking at Kylaq, it is selling not because it is a cheap car, it is selling because it comes from a reputable brand which has technology and safety and their cars are not too overpriced as well. 
If C5 aircross could fall in 20-25 lakh range when it launched, it could attract premium customers willing to buy creta/safari/harrier etc. Then after establishing itself as a reputable brand they could have repeated success story with cheaper models too such as c3, basalt etc. 
But they failed in the beginning. 
What do you say guys?",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nwxm8y

My rear as well as passenger seats rarely get occupied in both glanza and i20 they are almost new! I’m 22 and not a family guy my parents prefer the safari to be chauffeured around. Also I will buy this car for sure in the coming months when it will get reduced to the ex showroom after discounts. Also i did booked the ertiga for my mom as her birthday gift because she loves roof mounted ac and ertiga discontinued it. Dealer had one last car with roof ac and i bought it for 10.75. Also will use the car as a rental as my family driver sits around all the time and paying him salary won’t make much sense and this will help me with paying the emi’s and pre payment! Hopefully in 27th oct the car will be hers.❤️",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nwxm8y
