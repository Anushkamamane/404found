comment,cars,1ntl2pt,Ford’s CEO isn’t impressed with Apple CarPlay Ultra,,"Except, they're kind of in it together. There's a reason Google pays Apple Billions a year, to make sure that Google stays as the default search app on iPhones.

*Google paid Apple approximately $20 billion in 2022 to remain the default search engine on Apple's Safari browser, and this figure has been cited in a Department of Justice antitrust case against Google. The payment represents nearly half of Google's total search traffic and is a significant portion of Apple's Services revenue.* ([SOURCE](https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/05/06/googles-default-search-payments-to-apple-at-risk-in-antitrust-lawsuit))

So, while Apple touts that they don't sell your data, they are more than happy to take payment for access to it, from Google. So, how innocent are they really? I mean, they are literally profiting off of your private data. They're just letting someone else do the dirty work of collecting it.",https://www.theverge.com/transportation/786376/ford-jim-farley-apple-carplay-ultra-decoder
comment,CarsIndia,1nwxm8y,Best VFM car in the country!,"Test drove the Citroën Aircross a month back and honestly it’s way out of its league. The comfort is next level — suspension just glides over bad roads, seats are super supportive, and the torque delivery feels almost diesel-like for easy overtakes. Today they launched the new Aircross X variant starting at ₹8.29L, which adds ventilated seats, 360° camera, wireless charging, leatherette dash, ambient lighting and more. With the recent price cuts + 5-star Bharat NCAP rating, this thing is hands down the most VFM SUV in the country right now.","We could have been interested if they had kept c5 aircross in the price range of harrier, they failed there and then rest is story. 
Looking at Kylaq, it is selling not because it is a cheap car, it is selling because it comes from a reputable brand which has technology and safety and their cars are not too overpriced as well. 
If C5 aircross could fall in 20-25 lakh range when it launched, it could attract premium customers willing to buy creta/safari/harrier etc. Then after establishing itself as a reputable brand they could have repeated success story with cheaper models too such as c3, basalt etc. 
But they failed in the beginning. 
What do you say guys?",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nwxm8y
comment,CarsIndia,1nwsv8i,JEEP Compass 4WD or 2WD,I'm planning to get a JEEP Compass. I'm confused to whether go for the 2WD 6 speed manual or 4WD 9 speed torque converter. ,It’s also priced high which makes competing against the xuv or safaris of the world,https://i.redd.it/0179gy7mqusf1.jpeg
