@utkarshdwivedi6600,Safari is near perfect but lacks on few major stuff 1st & most important its dash it look like  10lac cars dash i have suggestions tata should take inspiration from either ford or vw & skoda their steering wheel look classy n modern forget them just see land rovers steering the infotainment love to see xuv like infotainment. N thud of gates i dont know why but it doesn't give same thud as superb or fortuner & last give it a new engine 190+ bhp petrol/ or hybrid with your 170bhp to reach ot 200bhp these will give safari a proper heavy weight why would somebuy a fortuner when you are getting a similar in styling but better internally. When a folk go for a safari over harrier he clearly going for proper premium make safari little expensive but make it more elegant make its engine more refine give it power to do drag these things are not practical but have a very big psycological impact.,0,2022-05-27T20:38:32Z,Positive
@sanjibg1.1,Did not like the complete dark interior. Dark exterior with Kaziranga type seat/ interior would be a killer combination. Can Tata do that or give that option ? At least an option to have dark exterior with usual interiors.,1,2022-04-05T17:19:01Z,Negative

@vigneshlx4300,"I have booked safari dark over over Xuv 700:
1) Superb road presence.  Can compete with fortuner,  though it is a segment above.
2) Interior feels plush (except for poor infotainment system) due to soft touch materials used.
3) Get a 7 seater. Because safari is proper 7 seater or atleast you can use it as 6 seater by tumbling one side of the last row seat to increase the boot capacity. 

Do not buy 6 seater in safari or other cars, because in this segment, the last row is not so wide like fortuner or endeavors. And ultimately, you will be forced to use this 6 seater as 4 seater car due to compromised last row. 

This is unacceptable, if you fathom that triber or ertiga is good 7 seater than these cars are.

In case of Hector or alacazar, it is a 4 seater (if you are going for 6 seater configuration), because last row is barely usable. 
4) All features except for adas, are present in safari too. Bad impression comes due to infotainment systems.
5) JBL is very good over Sony speakers. It may seem weird, but park xuv700 and safari and play same song, you'll understand what I am saying. Somehow the bass and treble is better in JBL. Sony was just being loud than JBL. Quality was compromised.",16,2022-02-10T02:25:35Z,Positive

@soumitrachatterjee4703,"Seriously, an update for the infotainment is required. And they should launch a petrol ASAP and crash test it. The reason they didn't do it in the diesel car is because it has a deadly problem, which can break the driver's knee in an event of head on collision. They realized this after they made the deal with Fiat for 70,000 diesel engines. Seriously, they should at least add 360-degree camera. Addition of ADAS would be nice, but addition of the more basic and fundamental features would be great. Especially if they want to boost sales.",2,2022-02-09T07:05:32Z,Positive

Better HeadLamps..
360 cam
Ventillated seats and wireless charger (in standard colours also).. I think they have started doing this!
Option of 4x4 (not for me)..

IF TATA EVER DID THESE THINGS TO SAFARI (with increasing proice ofcourse) ,IT WILL BECOME A VIABLE REPLACEMENT OF FORTUNER!!

But the new safari is a monocoque -  (car like) chassis with a frint wheel drive based layout where engine is mounted transversely or sideways with all wheel drive integration.... So it's basically an front wheel biased druve train whwre engine senrs mote power to front wheels .... Its nit a typical 4*4 odf road worthy ...

@ShivrohitVanagondi,"Hi there, I watched your videos on YouTube and think you might be able to help me with some questions. I‚Äôm considering the Safari, XUV700, and Scorpio N for my needs. I have a large family of seven, and I plan to travel across India‚Äînot to extreme locations like deserts, but to places like Ladakh, Spiti, and Manali where there might be snow and black ice.

I‚Äôm wondering if the Safari will be suitable for these conditions or if I should opt for the XUV700 with all-wheel drive or the Scorpio N with 4x4. I‚Äôm leaning towards the Safari due to its impressive road presence and comfort, but the XUV700 is appealing for its performance. However, I‚Äôm also concerned about the reliability of Tata cars. Do you think the Safari is reliable? If you were choosing a new car, would you go for the Safari or a Mahindra model?",1,2024-09-01T06:36:09Z,Positive

Despite Tata's excellent crash ratings, I have 15 years of driving experience in basic cars like the 800 and Alto, which lacked safety features. This has made me a cautious driver. For the past five years, I've enjoyed the security of advanced safety features, so fumbling with non-physical controls and diverting my attention from the road doesn't make sense.
