"👍 Let’s make this Harrier EV flood-proofed for real-world Indian monsoons and occasional water crossings. Since it’s an EV, the strategy is different from ICE SUVs: instead of adding snorkels, the focus is on water sealing, electronics, and driveline protection.

🔧 Harrier EV – Mods & Precautions for Max Wading Safety

1. Battery & High Voltage System

IP67 pack is already sealed, but the weak points are connectors, service plugs, and underbody covers.

Add:

Rubberized underbody coating for the battery tray.

Silicone sealing / dielectric grease on exposed HV connectors (orange cables, inverter, motor connections).

Protective skid plate (stainless or aluminum) with drain holes → shields from debris and pressure waves.




---

2. Motors & Differentials

Harrier EV AWD uses dual motors (front + rear). Motors and gear reduction housings usually have breathers like diffs.

Extend breathers with tubing routed to the top of the firewall or A-pillar.

Use hydrophobic filters (Sintra / Donaldson type) at tube ends to prevent water/dust entry.



---

3. Low-Voltage Electronics

ECUs, relays, DC-DC converter, on-board charger are often mounted low.

Add:

Splash guards / shields for wheel wells and underside.

Marine-grade heat shrink + dielectric grease on all low-voltage connectors accessible underbody.

Secondary sealing for the cabin air intake and blower motor (common ingress point in floods).




---

4. Cooling & HVAC

EVs use liquid cooling for battery/motors, with radiators/fans upfront.

Risk: fans throwing water into electronics.

Mod: Install a manual fan cut-off switch or fuse pull method for deep crossings (dealership-dependent, as it voids warranty if hacked).

Relocate or shield coolant reservoir breathers upward.



---

5. Cabin & Body

Renew door/boot rubber seals (Harrier EV is still based on ICE Harrier body shell, not Defender-level sealing).

Apply automotive weatherproofing grease to door seals → prevents leaks.

Add floor pan plugs that can be removed post-fording to drain water quickly.

Use hydrophobic cabin filters to protect blower from splashes.



---

6. Recovery & Tyres

Fit rated recovery points front + rear (factory EV recovery points may not be strong).

Use synthetic rope winch (sealed motor) → steel cable corrodes faster in floods.

All-terrain tyres with aggressive tread help in soft riverbeds.

Maintain tyre pressure slightly lower (~28–30 psi) for better flotation in muddy streams.



---

7. Driver SOP (as important as mods!)

Always engage AWD mode + Terrain Response (if provided).

Enter slowly (2–5 km/h), build a gentle bow wave.

Never stop midstream → water pressure can enter seals.

After exiting:

Run brakes lightly to dry pads.

Check underbody for trapped debris.

Inspect diff/gear oils if repeatedly crossing >500 mm.




---

🏆 Harrier EV After Mods – Wading Ranking

Stock: 600 mm (best EV in India).

With above mods: Safe, reliable use up to 650–700 mm (beyond this, electronics risk grows).

For comparison:

Force Gurkha (diesel + snorkel): 700 mm.

Fortuner/Hilux (diesel + snorkel + breathers): 800 mm.

Defender OCTA (factory engineered): 1000 mm.



So: the Harrier EV can be pushed close to Fortuner-level wading with mods, but not to Defender extremes.

"The actuator issue is not as big a problem as it’s sometimes made out to be, and it shouldn’t be a deal breaker. Based on records from the last 2–3 years, the number of cases has reduced after Tata introduced a small cover for the Nexon’s actuator.

It’s also not true that people were frequently stranded at chargers due to the charging gun failing to unlock. Most users now know how to unlock it manually, and help is readily available through various forums.

With the 2025 Nexon 45, Tata has started fully covering the actuator from the bottom. This prevents mud splashes on the actuator, which used to be the main cause of failures. The same cover is now also provided on the Harrier. The only trade-off is that reaching the actuator now requires removing the cover.",the actuator issue is not as big a problem as its sometimes made out to be and it shouldnt be a deal breaker based on records from the last years the number of cases has reduced after tata introduced a small cover for the nexons actuator its also not true that people were frequently stranded at chargers due to the charging gun failing to unlock most users now know how to unlock it manually and help is readily available through various forums with the nexon tata has started fully covering the actuator from the bottom this prevents mud splashes on the actuator which used to be the main cause of failures the same cover is now also provided on the harrier the only tradeoff is that reaching the actuator now requires removing the cover,en,"The actuator issue is not as big a problem as it’s sometimes made out to be, and it shouldn’t be a deal breaker.

"Guys,
I spoke to Meherab just now. He is a genuine guy with good knowledge on EVs.

Things I learned from him
1. Tata is not as reliable as other high budget EVs are.
2. Service may be delayed and biased to known individuals.

Summary:
If you are ready to adjust small bits and have good relations with TATA service, you can go ahead with Harrier EV.


But if you are a person who feels that on spending 30 lakh, you will have a hassle free experience, you should think again.

"**A Family Perspective**
There were **three of us** in the car: me, my father, and the sales associate.
My father drove for about **20 km** and when we stopped, he looked at me and said just one word: **“Wow.”** Then he added with a smile, __""What’s stopping you from giving the final payment? Why the delay?""__
He found both the **front and rear seats very comfortable.** The only minor feedback he gave was a slight jump in the rear seat over humps (which wasn’t felt in the front). Even that was negligible and only in comparison to the front seats.

**ADAS A Lifesaver (Literally)**
The **ADAS system** worked brilliantly. It saved us **twice today**:
**1. Highway at 155 km/h**: A truck suddenly swerved into our lane. The Harrier EV **slammed the brakes hard and fast.** All of us including the sales associate in the back were wearing seatbelts, and I __highly__ recommend always doing so. My dad gave me a little “pooja” (if you know, you know) and immediately asked me to stick to 100 km after that 😅2. 
**City at 20 km/h**: An auto-rickshaw suddenly braked in front of us. ADAS intervened again but this time the braking was **smooth and gentle**, likely due to the low speed. I was shocked the **ADAS reacted faster than me**!3. 
All of this on **default ADAS settings** I didn’t tweak anything.

**Charging & Range Observations**
• Start Battery: **66%**• 
End Battery: **26%**• 
Odometer: From **933 km → 1134 km**• 
Distance Driven: **201 km**• 
Energy Consumption (Dashboard): **200 Wh/km**• 
Extrapolated Range: **~375 km** (This may be lower due to Sport/Boost mode use and not charging to 100%)•

There were **three of us** in the car: me, my father, and the sales associate.
My father drove for about **20 km** and when we stopped, he looked at me and said just one word: **“Wow.”** Then he added with a smile, __""What’s stopping you from giving the final payment? Why the delay?""__
He found both the **front and rear seats very comfortable.** The only minor feedback he gave was a slight jump in the rear seat over humps (which wasn’t felt in the front). Even that was negligible and only in comparison to the front seats.

**ADAS A Lifesaver (Literally)**
The **ADAS system** worked brilliantly. It saved us **twice today**:
**1. Highway at 155 km/h**: A truck suddenly swerved into our lane. The Harrier EV **slammed the brakes hard and fast.** All of us including the sales associate in the back were wearing seatbelts, and I __highly__ recommend always doing so. My dad gave me a little “pooja” (if you know, you know) and immediately asked me to stick to 100 km after that 😅2. 
**City at 20 km/h**: An auto-rickshaw suddenly braked in front of us. ADAS intervened again but this time the braking was **smooth and gentle**, likely due to the low speed. I was shocked the **ADAS reacted faster than me**!3. 
All of this on **default ADAS settings** I didn’t tweak anything.

**Charging & Range Observations**
• Start Battery: **66%**• 
End Battery: **26%**•

"**First Impressions & Tech Surprises**
The Harrier EV isn’t just a tech savvy car  it’s **Hi-Tech**, and truly packed with features. Honestly, you need to spend a **couple of hours just to understand and appreciate** what this machine offers. It's not just smart; it's **intelligently intuitive and true engineering leap by TATA.**

Initially, on the highway, I felt the steering was a bit stiff. Later, I realized it was due to **Lane Keep Assist** being ON. This system gently nudges you to stay within lanes, which might feel tight if you're trying to drive aggressively. Once I adjusted the settings  keeping only visual and audio lane alerts active the steering became smooth like butter.

**Performance – A Beast in SUVs not just EVs**

The Harrier EV is very powerful. **I touched a top speed of 155 km/h** (I didn’t go beyond due to safety). What shocked me was that I hit **145 km/h even in Eco mode** and it didn’t feel like the car was trying too hard.

On curves at over 110 km/h, the car was planted and confident **no drama, no sway, just smooth control.** Even village roads posed no challenge the suspension and ride quality handled it effortlessly.",first impressions tech surprises the harrier ev isnt just a tech savvy car its hitech and truly packed with features honestly you need to spend a couple of hours just to understand and appreciate what this machine offers its not just smart its intelligently intuitive and true engineering leap by tata initially on the highway i felt the steering was a bit stiff later i realized it was due to lane keep assist being on this system gently nudges you to stay within lanes which might feel tight if youre trying to drive aggressively once i adjusted the settings keeping only visual and audio lane alerts active the steering became smooth like butter performance a beast in suvs not just evs the harrier ev is very powerful i touched a top speed of kmh i didnt go beyond due to safety what shocked me was that i hit kmh even in eco mode and it didnt feel like the car was trying too hard on curves at over kmh the car was planted and confident no drama no sway just smooth control even village roads posed no challenge the suspension and ride quality handled it effortlessly,en,"**First Impressions & Tech Surprises**

Took the test drive of XEV 9E & Harrier EV on same road, driven back to back for 100 kms
My and family observations were quite opposite to this guy

Hell all the people who have done the test drive, have just the opposite to this great reviewer 

Because of side step, Harrier EV is the easiest to get in and out
BE 6 is most pathetic, everyone hit their head while getting in and out

Ergonomic wise : Harrier EV > XEV 9E 

despite the wheelbase and length advantages of XEV 9E, rear seat space is comparable 
XEV 9E has just slightly better knee room ( ~ 0.5 - 1"" )
But the biggest difference is Rear Headroom 
My head was just about brushing against roof in XEV 9E 
No such problem in Harrier EV 
Both my brother & father being taller, they had no headroom in XEV 9E 
If you recline the rear seats, due to coupe shape the headroom becomes even worse

So knee room : XEV 9E > Harrier EV 
Headroom: Harrier EV >> XEV 9E 

Now coming to suspension part, heck even all reviewers are praising this car
Take Team BHP for example, they spent last 3 days driving XEV 9E before coming to Harrier EV media drive
Mahindra invited Team BHP, booked their flight and stays and arranged everything for them to experience XEV 9E, as Mahindra knew Harrier EV media drive is coming in next days
And Team BHP observation was : Harrier EV has better suspension and ride quality than XEV 9E with semi active suspension 

During my test drive, drove both XEV 9E & Harrier EV on very bad roads 
My parents have back pain problem, guess which car they liked in ride comfort? Harrier EV 

And coming to the body roll part, took the same turn at 90kmph on highway in both cars, Both the vehicles are exactly same in terms of roll

So people kindly check for yourself before believing on someone's else words

There are lot of Cancellation on Mahindra Showroom for EVs, and a lot of negative stories are being created around Harrier EV 

Remember in this market, currently there is no better value for money product 

The same situation happened when Windsor EV was launched, everyone started pointed out rubbish things about car because every OEM was threatened for their product 

And Getting this guy some water, Harrier doors are narrow & opening is small? Seriously?

"My Observations on the Current Harrier EV QWD Range Testing:

From what I understand, the QWD version of the Harrier EV is what's currently being tested and showcased. So far, only a few sensible and controlled range tests have been done. The rest have primarily focused on showcasing terrain handling, ADAS functionality, and high-speed highway capabilities — all of which naturally reduce the effective range.

Key Factors Affecting Range:

Climate: Tests done in areas like Faridabad and Agra, where higher temperatures are common, naturally influence battery performance.

Drive Configuration: A rear-wheel-drive (RWD) setup could likely offer an additional 20–30 km of range under similar conditions, due to better efficiency.

Driving Behavior: Some testers were even driving with the sunroof open for example 

Regen & Speed Patterns:

Highway driving at 80–90 km/h with regen set to level 1 or 2 and AC usage in the 22–25°C range (intermittently on/off) will have a predictable impact.

City driving, especially with regen at level 3, helps contribute positively to the combined range.

Current Practical Results: Even after factoring in all the above variables, if the vehicle is delivering a real-world range around 450 km, that seems quite acceptable at this stage.

Expectations Going Forward: Post-launch, with over-the-air (OTA) software updates and optimizations, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the range improve towards 500 km in mixed driving conditions — which would make the offering quite strong.

From what I understand, the QWD version of the Harrier EV is what's currently being tested and showcased. So far, only a few sensible and controlled range tests have been done. The rest have primarily focused on showcasing terrain handling, ADAS functionality, and high-speed highway capabilities — all of which naturally reduce the effective range.

Key Factors Affecting Range:

Climate: Tests done in areas like Faridabad and Agra, where higher temperatures are common, naturally influence battery performance.

Drive Configuration: A rear-wheel-drive (RWD) setup could likely offer an additional 20–30 km of range under similar conditions, due to better efficiency.

Driving Behavior: Some testers were even driving with the sunroof open for example 

Regen & Speed Patterns:

Highway driving at 80–90 km/h with regen set to level 1 or 2 and AC usage in the 22–25°C range (intermittently on/off) will have a predictable impact.

City driving, especially with regen at level 3, helps contribute positively to the combined range.

Current Practical Results: Even after factoring in all the above variables, if the vehicle is delivering a real-world range around 450 km, that seems quite acceptable at this stage.

Expectations Going Forward: Post-launch, with over-the-air (OTA) software updates and optimizations, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the range improve towards 500 km in mixed driving conditions — which would make the offering quite strong.

"My views after seeing 8 to 10 range test videos on YT...

Will get about 400 km range with battery from 100 to 10%.
City drive will give little more range. 
There will be initial glitches.
There is a lot of power in the car and the built is solid (thats why it's heavy)
The AWD can be used as RWD if the pedal is softly used.

Points to note....

If you see the initial BE6 and XEV9 range test videos, they were also getting around 400km of range and after approx 3 months, with couple of software updates, the range is improved to around 500km...

Yes Harrier is heavy and battery is 4 KW smaller to Mahindra twins, so expect a less range of 40 kms....",my views after seeing to range test videos on yt will get about km range with battery from to city drive will give little more range there will be initial glitches there is a lot of power in the car and the built is solid thats why its heavy the awd can be used as rwd if the pedal is softly used points to note if you see the initial be and xev range test videos they were also getting around km of range and after approx months with couple of software updates the range is improved to around km yes harrier is heavy and battery is kw smaller to mahindra twins so expect a less range of kms,en,"My views after seeing 8 to 10 range test videos on YT...

"Hi,

I own a Tata Safari Accomplished+ automatic 2024 model.

Yesterday I was crushing on highway, suddenly started seeing errors on my dashboard. Errors such as, TPMS malfunction, LKA malfunction, Hill assist malfunction, etc. I stopped my vehicle on the side and turned it off. After that when I tried to start the vehicle, it didn't start. Called RSA they tried jump starting it, but the vehicle turned off as soon as they removed the secondary battery support. Towed the vehicle to nearest service centre after 10 hour struggling on road. The battery in my car was replaced under warranty 2 weeks back.

"I had a disappointing experience with this service center. Two weeks ago, I visited for DEF refueling, which took nearly two hours for a very minor task. Despite this negative first impression, I decided to give them another opportunity by booking my Harrier’s 90,000 km major service, along with their pick-and-drop facility.

The pickup point was just 3 km away, hardly a 7-minute drive from the service center, and the committed pickup time was 9:30 a.m. However, even after waiting until 10:30 a.m., no one arrived. I had to make multiple follow-up calls, during which I was given the name of one pickup person, then another after 20 minutes, and later even a third. The lack of coordination and delay ultimately led me to cancel the service request.

Based on these repeated inefficiencies, I would strongly suggest that customers carefully reconsider before entrusting their vehicles here. During my first visit as well, I observed several dissatisfied customers expressing frustration, which now seems understandable.

"**Hi everyone, looking for some guidance.**
Just to give you some context — I own a **2022 Tata Harrier Kaziranga edition (top-end)**, though the **registration is from Jan 2023**. I’ve driven around **35,000 km** so far without any major issues.

However, **yesterday the car wouldn’t start**, and when I contacted the service center, they suspected a **battery issue** and said it might need replacement. The service technician mentioned that this is a **common issue in Harrier models**, with battery replacements often required **within 18 to 24 months**.

I’ve never faced any starting trouble until now, so this came as a surprise. He also mentioned the **battery cost would be around ₹10,000**, but said he would confirm the exact amount.

Would really appreciate any insights from fellow owners. A few specific questions:
 • Has anyone else faced a similar battery issue this early with their Harrier?
 • Is it normal for Harrier batteries to need replacement in just 18–24 months?
 • Would you recommend trying to **recharge the battery** instead of replacing it?
 • If I get the battery recharged or replaced **outside the service center**, would that **affect the vehicle warranty**?
 • Any particular **battery brand or type** you’d recommend if replacement is needed?

"What are you trying to prove??

You told that car engine will strain on eco mode.

I told car engine won't strain on eco mode.

Again you bought a piece of evidence from JD Power website that eco mode don't affect or strain the engine of higher cc car.

Again you are telling that car engine will strain on eco mode.

No bro it won't... Eco mode will only strain lower cc car but not harrier.

Harrier is a higher cc car. 

What you are claiming may applicable for engine below 1000cc..

If you feel like your car was straining on eco mode on city traffic conditions. Keep that perception with you. No need to push that perception on others without proper piece of evidence to prove!!!

If it's straining as you are claiming then harrier won't sell this much. Manufacturer came into play and will notify on manual and other areas not use eco mode on city traffic conditions. Today conversation won't be happening.

Finally you called me brainless, common senseless, dumb and idiot because I am not complied with your perception. 



Do you have any idea on how many steps involved before releasing a model such as harrier which is a flagship of Tata motors???



Do you think manufacturer will create an engine which straining on eco mode and sell it to people??



This is the most dumbest, stupidity that someone can come across.



Finally I am trying to sell my course by opposing your opinion??

"*Got this from google AI *

No, driving a Tata Harrier in Eco mode does not cause any damage to the car, it primarily optimizes fuel consumption by adjusting engine and transmission settings. 

Here's a more detailed explanation:

**Eco Mode Functionality:**Eco mode in most modern cars, including the Harrier, is designed to improve fuel efficiency by: 
**Adjusting Transmission:** It typically shifts gears at lower engine RPMs, which can lead to slightly slower acceleration but better fuel economy. 
**Limiting Throttle Response:** The throttle response is also made less sensitive, encouraging a smoother and more relaxed driving style. 



**No Harm to the Engine:**The changes made by Eco mode are temporary and do not cause any long-term damage to the engine or transmission. 


**When to Use Eco Mode:**
Eco mode is best suited for situations where you prioritize fuel economy over performance, such as: **Long Highway Drives:** When you're cruising at a steady speed with minimal acceleration and braking. 
**Relaxed Driving:** When you're not in a hurry and prefer a smoother, more relaxed driving experience. 



**When to Avoid Eco Mode:**
You should avoid using Eco mode when you need quick acceleration or responsive handling, such as: **City Driving:** In stop-and-go traffic, the reduced throttle response can make Eco mode feel sluggish. 
**Overtaking:** When you need to quickly accelerate to overtake other vehicle",got this from google ai no driving a tata harrier in eco mode does not cause any damage to the car it primarily optimizes fuel consumption by adjusting engine and transmission settings heres a more detailed explanation eco mode functionalityeco mode in most modern cars including the harrier is designed to improve fuel efficiency by adjusting transmission it typically shifts gears at lower engine rpms which can lead to slightly slower acceleration but better fuel economy limiting throttle response the throttle response is also made less sensitive encouraging a smoother and more relaxed driving style no harm to the enginethe changes made by eco mode are temporary and do not cause any longterm damage to the engine or transmission when to use eco mode eco mode is best suited for situations where you prioritize fuel economy over performance such as long highway drives when youre cruising at a steady speed with minimal acceleration and braking relaxed driving when youre not in a hurry and prefer a smoother more relaxed driving experience when to avoid eco mode you should avoid using eco mode when you need quick acceleration or responsive handling such as city driving in stopandgo traffic the reduced throttle response can make eco mode feel sluggish overtaking when you need to quickly accelerate to overtake other vehicle,en,"*Got this from google AI *

"Have recently bought Safari accomplished plus Dark edition. Would like to Thank this community for helping me clear lot of apprehensions. Special mention for [Karthikeyan](tg://user?id=1854832976) although I never interacted with  [Karthikeyan](tg://user?id=1854832976) but his energy and the way he supports the community is phenomenal......

Had brought cars from various manufacturers but never have i been this apprehensive.... Tata is my first experience,  to be honest I was very reluctant with after sales service and quality of the product.....did my research for the longest period and been on this group to understand the experiences and buyers first hand experience with Safari...although after sales service is questioned.....I personally had an amazing experience with Tata Orange Hyd and also the support they provided so far for some initial hick ups.
