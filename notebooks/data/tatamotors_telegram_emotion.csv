🔧 Harrier EV – Mods & Precautions for Max Wading Safety

1. Battery & High Voltage System

IP67 pack is already sealed, but the weak points are connectors, service plugs, and underbody covers.

Add:

Rubberized underbody coating for the battery tray.

Silicone sealing / dielectric grease on exposed HV connectors (orange cables, inverter, motor connections).

Protective skid plate (stainless or aluminum) with drain holes → shields from debris and pressure waves.




---

2. Motors & Differentials

Harrier EV AWD uses dual motors (front + rear). Motors and gear reduction housings usually have breathers like diffs.

Extend breathers with tubing routed to the top of the firewall or A-pillar.

Use hydrophobic filters (Sintra / Donaldson type) at tube ends to prevent water/dust entry.



---

3. Low-Voltage Electronics

ECUs, relays, DC-DC converter, on-board charger are often mounted low.

Add:

Splash guards / shields for wheel wells and underside.

Marine-grade heat shrink + dielectric grease on all low-voltage connectors accessible underbody.

Secondary sealing for the cabin air intake and blower motor (common ingress point in floods).




---

4. Cooling & HVAC

EVs use liquid cooling for battery/motors, with radiators/fans upfront.

Risk: fans throwing water into electronics.

Mod: Install a manual fan cut-off switch or fuse pull method for deep crossings (dealership-dependent, as it voids warranty if hacked).

Relocate or shield coolant reservoir breathers upward.



---

5. Cabin & Body

Renew door/boot rubber seals (Harrier EV is still based on ICE Harrier body shell, not Defender-level sealing).

Apply automotive weatherproofing grease to door seals → prevents leaks.

Add floor pan plugs that can be removed post-fording to drain water quickly.

Use hydrophobic cabin filters to protect blower from splashes.



---

6. Recovery & Tyres

Fit rated recovery points front + rear (factory EV recovery points may not be strong).

Use synthetic rope winch (sealed motor) → steel cable corrodes faster in floods.

All-terrain tyres with aggressive tread help in soft riverbeds.

Maintain tyre pressure slightly lower (~28–30 psi) for better flotation in muddy streams.



---

7. Driver SOP (as important as mods!)

Always engage AWD mode + Terrain Response (if provided).

Enter slowly (2–5 km/h), build a gentle bow wave.

Never stop midstream → water pressure can enter seals.

After exiting:

Run brakes lightly to dry pads.

Check underbody for trapped debris.

Inspect diff/gear oils if repeatedly crossing >500 mm.




---

🏆 Harrier EV After Mods – Wading Ranking

Stock: 600 mm (best EV in India).

With above mods: Safe, reliable use up to 650–700 mm (beyond this, electronics risk grows).

For comparison:

Force Gurkha (diesel + snorkel): 700 mm.

Fortuner/Hilux (diesel + snorkel + breathers): 800 mm.

Defender OCTA (factory engineered): 1000 mm.



So: the Harrier EV can be pushed close to Fortuner-level wading with mods, but not to Defender extremes. Its strength is sealed battery IP67 + AWD traction, weakness is electronics placement and cooling fans",0.08888888888888889,0.07777777777777778,0.044444444444444446,0.15555555555555556,0.044444444444444446,0.24444444444444444,0.25555555555555554,0.044444444444444446,0.03333333333333333,0.011111111111111112

I spoke to Meherab just now. He is a genuine guy with good knowledge on EVs.

Things I learned from him
1. Tata is not as reliable as other high budget EVs are.
2. Service may be delayed and biased to known individuals.

Summary:
If you are ready to adjust small bits and have good relations with TATA service, you can go ahead with Harrier EV.


But if you are a person who feels that on spending 30 lakh, you will have a hassle free experience, you should think again.

For its price, for what it offers, for how it makes you __feel behind the wheel__ **it is super, super, super value for money.**

There were **three of us** in the car: me, my father, and the sales associate.
My father drove for about **20 km** and when we stopped, he looked at me and said just one word: **“Wow.”** Then he added with a smile, __""What’s stopping you from giving the final payment? Why the delay?""__
He found both the **front and rear seats very comfortable.** The only minor feedback he gave was a slight jump in the rear seat over humps (which wasn’t felt in the front). Even that was negligible and only in comparison to the front seats.

**ADAS A Lifesaver (Literally)**
The **ADAS system** worked brilliantly. It saved us **twice today**:
**1. Highway at 155 km/h**: A truck suddenly swerved into our lane. The Harrier EV **slammed the brakes hard and fast.** All of us including the sales associate in the back were wearing seatbelts, and I __highly__ recommend always doing so. My dad gave me a little “pooja” (if you know, you know) and immediately asked me to stick to 100 km after that 😅2. 
**City at 20 km/h**: An auto-rickshaw suddenly braked in front of us. ADAS intervened again but this time the braking was **smooth and gentle**, likely due to the low speed. I was shocked the **ADAS reacted faster than me**!3. 
All of this on **default ADAS settings** I didn’t tweak anything.

The Harrier EV isn’t just a tech savvy car  it’s **Hi-Tech**, and truly packed with features. Honestly, you need to spend a **couple of hours just to understand and appreciate** what this machine offers. It's not just smart; it's **intelligently intuitive and true engineering leap by TATA.**

This is going to be a long message, straight from my heart and personal experience. Let me start by saying clearly: **I am not a promoter, influencer, or associated with Tata in any way.** I walked into this test drive with curiosity, and I walked out a genuine fanboy of the __Tata Harrier EV.__

**The Drive: 201 km of Discovery**
Today, I drove a total of **201 km** in the Harrier EV. Here's a breakdown:
**• ~50 km in peak city traffic**
**• ~150 km on highways**
I tested every mode available:
**• City**
**• Eco**
**• Sport**
**• Sport+ Boost**

I spent an average of **30 km in each mode**, except for City mode, where I drove nearly **100 km**.
I also experimented with **regen levels** (0, 1, 2, and 3) across these modes. Due to all this mode switching, my personal photos and range observations may not reflect typical consumption they’re more for reference than final conclusions.

201,"My wife is 5'3"" , I am 5'10"", my father & brother is 6'2""
Took the test drive of XEV 9E & Harrier EV on same road, driven back to back for 100 kms
My and family observations were quite opposite to this guy

Hell all the people who have done the test drive, have just the opposite to this great reviewer 

Because of side step, Harrier EV is the easiest to get in and out
BE 6 is most pathetic, everyone hit their head while getting in and out

Ergonomic wise : Harrier EV > XEV 9E 

despite the wheelbase and length advantages of XEV 9E, rear seat space is comparable 
XEV 9E has just slightly better knee room ( ~ 0.5 - 1"" )
But the biggest difference is Rear Headroom 
My head was just about brushing against roof in XEV 9E 
No such problem in Harrier EV 
Both my brother & father being taller, they had no headroom in XEV 9E 
If you recline the rear seats, due to coupe shape the headroom becomes even worse

So knee room : XEV 9E > Harrier EV 
Headroom: Harrier EV >> XEV 9E 

Now coming to suspension part, heck even all reviewers are praising this car
Take Team BHP for example, they spent last 3 days driving XEV 9E before coming to Harrier EV media drive
Mahindra invited Team BHP, booked their flight and stays and arranged everything for them to experience XEV 9E, as Mahindra knew Harrier EV media drive is coming in next days
And Team BHP observation was : Harrier EV has better suspension and ride quality than XEV 9E with semi active suspension 

During my test drive, drove both XEV 9E & Harrier EV on very bad roads 
My parents have back pain problem, guess which car they liked in ride comfort? Harrier EV 

And coming to the body roll part, took the same turn at 90kmph on highway in both cars, Both the vehicles are exactly same in terms of roll

So people kindly check for yourself before believing on someone's else words

There are lot of Cancellation on Mahindra Showroom for EVs, and a lot of negative stories are being created around Harrier EV 

Remember in this market, currently there is no better value for money product 

The same situation happened when Windsor EV was launched, everyone started pointed out rubbish things about car because every OEM was threatened for their product 

And Getting this guy some water, Harrier doors are narrow & opening is small? Seriously?

But it's only in the pack 3 which is 36L on road in Bangalore. Harrier is not that bad in suspension, its decent enough.

353,"My Observations on the Current Harrier EV QWD Range Testing:

From what I understand, the QWD version of the Harrier EV is what's currently being tested and showcased. So far, only a few sensible and controlled range tests have been done. The rest have primarily focused on showcasing terrain handling, ADAS functionality, and high-speed highway capabilities — all of which naturally reduce the effective range.

Key Factors Affecting Range:

Climate: Tests done in areas like Faridabad and Agra, where higher temperatures are common, naturally influence battery performance.

Drive Configuration: A rear-wheel-drive (RWD) setup could likely offer an additional 20–30 km of range under similar conditions, due to better efficiency.

Driving Behavior: Some testers were even driving with the sunroof open for example 

Regen & Speed Patterns:

Highway driving at 80–90 km/h with regen set to level 1 or 2 and AC usage in the 22–25°C range (intermittently on/off) will have a predictable impact.

City driving, especially with regen at level 3, helps contribute positively to the combined range.

Current Practical Results: Even after factoring in all the above variables, if the vehicle is delivering a real-world range around 450 km, that seems quite acceptable at this stage.

Expectations Going Forward: Post-launch, with over-the-air (OTA) software updates and optimizations, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the range improve towards 500 km in mixed driving conditions — which would make the offering quite strong. As said earlier Mahindra XEV 9E and BE6 79kw/h batter initially gave around 400 ish kms now few claim they have even got 550 around.

354,"My views after seeing 8 to 10 range test videos on YT...

Will get about 400 km range with battery from 100 to 10%.
City drive will give little more range. 
There will be initial glitches.
There is a lot of power in the car and the built is solid (thats why it's heavy)
The AWD can be used as RWD if the pedal is softly used.

Points to note....

If you see the initial BE6 and XEV9 range test videos, they were also getting around 400km of range and after approx 3 months, with couple of software updates, the range is improved to around 500km...

Yes Harrier is heavy and battery is 4 KW smaller to Mahindra twins, so expect a less range of 40 kms....",0.0,0.2,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.3,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0

Didnt like AC vents on the pillars, they should have offered blower control for rear seats, thats a big miss in India. 
cabin is not airy when compared to XEV 9E. Boot space is also less in comparison to xev 9e, not just in litres, but visually its less efficiently managed in harrier.",0.05,0.0,0.15,0.15,0.15,0.2,0.15,0.0,0.0,0.15

Despite this negative first impression, I decided to give them another opportunity by booking my Harrier’s 90,000 km major service, along with their pick-and-drop facility.

The pickup point was just 3 km away, hardly a 7-minute drive from the service center, and the committed pickup time was 9:30 a.m. However, even after waiting until 10:30 a.m., no one arrived. I had to make multiple follow-up calls, during which I was given the name of one pickup person, then another after 20 minutes, and later even a third. The lack of coordination and delay ultimately led me to cancel the service request.

Based on these repeated inefficiencies, I would strongly suggest that customers carefully reconsider before entrusting their vehicles here. During my first visit as well, I observed several dissatisfied customers expressing frustration, which now seems understandable.

462,"**Hi everyone, looking for some guidance.**
Just to give you some context — I own a **2022 Tata Harrier Kaziranga edition (top-end)**, though the **registration is from Jan 2023**. I’ve driven around **35,000 km** so far without any major issues.

However, **yesterday the car wouldn’t start**, and when I contacted the service center, they suspected a **battery issue** and said it might need replacement. The service technician mentioned that this is a **common issue in Harrier models**, with battery replacements often required **within 18 to 24 months**.

I’ve never faced any starting trouble until now, so this came as a surprise. He also mentioned the **battery cost would be around ₹10,000**, but said he would confirm the exact amount.

Would really appreciate any insights from fellow owners. A few specific questions:
 • Has anyone else faced a similar battery issue this early with their Harrier?
 • Is it normal for Harrier batteries to need replacement in just 18–24 months?
 • Would you recommend trying to **recharge the battery** instead of replacing it?
 • If I get the battery recharged or replaced **outside the service center**, would that **affect the vehicle warranty**?
 • Any particular **battery brand or type** you’d recommend if replacement is needed?

No, driving a Tata Harrier in Eco mode does not cause any damage to the car, it primarily optimizes fuel consumption by adjusting engine and transmission settings. 

Here's a more detailed explanation:

**Eco Mode Functionality:**Eco mode in most modern cars, including the Harrier, is designed to improve fuel efficiency by: 
**Adjusting Transmission:** It typically shifts gears at lower engine RPMs, which can lead to slightly slower acceleration but better fuel economy. 
**Limiting Throttle Response:** The throttle response is also made less sensitive, encouraging a smoother and more relaxed driving style. 



**No Harm to the Engine:**The changes made by Eco mode are temporary and do not cause any long-term damage to the engine or transmission. 


**When to Use Eco Mode:**
Eco mode is best suited for situations where you prioritize fuel economy over performance, such as: **Long Highway Drives:** When you're cruising at a steady speed with minimal acceleration and braking. 
**Relaxed Driving:** When you're not in a hurry and prefer a smoother, more relaxed driving experience. 



**When to Avoid Eco Mode:**
You should avoid using Eco mode when you need quick acceleration or responsive handling, such as: **City Driving:** In stop-and-go traffic, the reduced throttle response can make Eco mode feel sluggish. 
**Overtaking:** When you need to quickly accelerate to overtake other vehicle",0.06976744186046512,0.11627906976744186,0.11627906976744186,0.13953488372093023,0.023255813953488372,0.13953488372093023,0.23255813953488372,0.09302325581395349,0.046511627906976744,0.023255813953488372
