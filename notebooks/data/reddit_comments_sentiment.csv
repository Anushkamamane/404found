The service will also come to PC this year (or you can use an Android emulator right now). Resolution is currently limited to 720p and it highly depends on your Internet connection and device whether or not it'll work well enough (haven't had a good experience yet), but it's still in Beta so it'll likely be improved over time.

If we were talking about the Q5 I wouldn’t have even said anything because you’d be right. But the Macan isn’t that cookie cutter compared to the competition. 

For example, dynamically, my Stelvio is better than my Z because of the fact my Stelvio is literally a 5 inch higher SUV. Yeah, the Z’s handling is a more “pure” experience, but when something hustles a backroad and it’s the size of a Macan or a Stelvio, it’s a testament to being actually special for it’s category and what it offers for space and practicality.

"I think the sales were a direct result of pricing and lack of keeping the Gladiator up to date with features the Wrangler received.

The pricing got completely out of hand. Which I think had a bigger impact on a new product compared to an established one. They were often times with an MSRP that was $10K-$15K more than the competition.

They also still have not released a 4XE version of the Gladiator despite talking about it for approaching two years now. They never released a 392 version either.

"Yes, the 308 (and all older mid-engine Ferraris up to and including the 355 - at least the attainable ones to my knowledge, I dunno about others ...) require engine-out service. At minimum it's for the timing belts, and time/mileage estimates may vary (I've read 3-5 years and 15-25k miles from various owners, which may be accelerated due to track usage.) It seems that at the same time, people tend to do a minor teardown to see what's under the various covers and so forth, and people tend to refresh gaskets, hoses, and so forth.

If you have a jig to do it and you've done it a few times, it is apparently not _bad_, merely time-consuming. If you have all the parts ready to go and no surprises it might take a weekend of labor, with a lift, a jig designed for that engine's shape to accept and support the engine, and so on.

From what I have seen, the 308 follows the usual mantra of: the more you drive it, the less you pay per mile of driving. Between maintenance you do every year, and the average costs of big items (like engine-outs) spread out over a few years, you might pay anywhere between $0.50 a mile and like $5 a mile. I would imagine that a rental company pays on the lower end of that scale, despite some abuse by renters; I also imagine they charge ... a minimum of $800/day for a 200 mile limit and then like $2.50/mile or something like that.

With that said, if you buy a 308 that's been sitting around un-serviced and you want to bring it up to spec, and you bring it to a ferrari dealer in a high cost of living area (aren't they all in high cost of living areas?) you may indeed pay $26k to get it all running. But that is, I think, a fairly unusual situation. Major services done at dealers seem to get quoted at around half that. Plus or minus, caveat emptor.",en,"Yes, the 308 (and all older mid-engine Ferraris up to and including the 355 - at least the attainable ones to my knowledge, I dunno about others ...) require engine-out service.

"/u/gimpwiz is essentially correct. 

We try to collect the parts we know we'll need ahead of time and plan to spend 4 weekends in all (often waiting on parts we did not know we needed) to do the job. An independent who knows these cars will charge in the $5K to 8K range. If you are unlucky and have bad valve guides (relatively common one time job in the F355, but less so in other V8 Ferraris) you can expect to spend several thousand more in parts and machine shop work.

First weekend is prepping the shop and removing the engine. You need tables and/or racks with ways to organize and label the parts as they come off the car. There are a ton of things to disconnect or move out of the way and it needs to be done in a specific order.

Following weekend is disassembly of parts of the motor, inspect, prepare additional parts list, send out stuff for repair/rebuilding. 

The third weekend is often spent twiddling your thumbs while parts get shipped. You might get to put some stuff back together. Setting the timing using a degree wheel is critical to getting the most our of these engines. Don't depend on lining up timing marks.

The fourth weekend is spent re-installing the engine. It's very painstaking because access can be challenging and you want everything to be buttoned up correctly the first time. Taking shortcuts here is what often results in engine fires. 

A pro can crank them out much faster than us of course.",en,"/u/gimpwiz is essentially correct.

IIRC he said he got a discount, but this is a 6 figure build for the normies.

"You are really confusing the issues here.  ALL cars break, period.  I don't care if you drive a Porsche or a Honda, they will all need work done eventually.  However, Porsches are more reliable relative to their German rivals (i.e., I'd take a used 911 over a used Audi any day of the week) and the prices for repairs are relative to the vehicles' values.

It will cost way less to rebuild an F22C than it will a Metzger.  It will cost way less to rebuild a W124 than it will a 964.  A Porsche uses a flat motor.

It is not cheap to pay someone to drop an engine, disassemble the heads, install new valve guides and springs, do machine work and clean the heads/pistons/valves, and so on.  If you want cheap, buy an LS.  That will break too eventually (e.g., LS motors tend to drop valves which is an issue with the C6 apparently), and the only difference is that motor will likely be cheaper to replace because it's not a 911.

VW and Porsche had the idea to buy all the parts and create Porsche Classic and VW Classic parts.

Now a distributer for 1980's VW Bus costs $350, while the same part (minimal work to do) from another VW car costs $70.

I had headwork done for my old BMW boxer bike. The cylinder head looks the same as the Porsche, also aicooled 2 valve. I got everything new (flat tappet, new valves, valve guides, springs, valve seats, rocker arms) and machined for $350 per head. 6 x $350 = $2100 

Double the price and you're still far away from $20 000.

"> but a Porsche is infinitely more reliable than an Audi. 

HAHAHA 

A 90's Audi, let's say the 90's quattro 20v with almost the same hp and production date, runs 300k miles. I had an early 90's Audi for over 150k miles and all I did was basic maintenance work and I drove it hard. 

Porsche was almost bankrupt in the 80's and 90's and limped around with old machines from the 50's and engine design from the 60's that got only the most basic upgrades. They wanted to scrap the 911, because it wasn't a modern car. Everything was old and the engine behind the rear axle, like a pre WWII Beetle (Porsche designed, too) was less than optimal. only because they could not afford to, because nobody wanted the 944 and 928, they had to keep it. Lucky them.

But with todays folklore and hype... totally kafkaesque.

"Oh, it’s exactly how you’d expect it to be considering how it looks. First off, an 80’s 911 steers nothing like a modern GT car to begin with. It has a manual rack, so much heavier than a modern car, while more communicative, but a slower ratio, therefore less direct than a modern (EPAS) car. The lift and extra sidewall means the steering is numbed down a bit, but this matters not in the city, with fundamentally only 90 degree turns, and it helps a lot on loose surface.

If I had a car like that and never went offroad, I would feel like just as much of a poser as those hard parking stance kids with race parts and gutted interiors that never do track days.

Car is sweet, I like that it's reversible, and if you can turn your own wrenches, you can build something like this for not a lot of money.  It's a 911 with pretty standard 911 mods (steve wong chip, ssis, dansk muffler, etc), but they clocked the swingarms downwards and retained the factory torsion bars, just installed longer shocks.

"The Leh Keen built cars are quite expensive, but that includes full interior refresh, repaint and engine maintenance / improvements.  The actual parts to lift the car are fairly reasonable (and in the right donor car a lot of the suspension parts would need to be replaced anyway)

Pretty sure Matt mentioned on the show his has the stage 2 kit which is 8 grand plus install (might have been stage 3 which is 11 grand), but there isn't any cutting or welding needed.  The skid plates would add some cost, but you could skip or downsize on the rally lights.

The Macan doesn't have anywhere near the same usability that a Safari 911 does. The sidewalls are shorter, the wheels necessarily bigger, the engine note and response less involving. You have to cane it to get oversteer and the components aren't quite as robust.

"I completely forgot about that challenge so I decided to go watch the Foxbody's video and Matt seems extremely happy with the car during his laps, and Justin Bell says the car is really good, but nervous if you overdrive it. Around 14:10 he talks about how balanced the car is up until you cross its limits. There's a lot of small corrections/countersteer but that doesn't indicate a poorly setup car. I don't see how you can tell that it's too stiff from the video either. Those are some quick laps for a car with ""only"" 300hp; quicker than the GT3's time that day.

Honestly, the in lap videos looks fairly similar to how someone would  get a well setup square S2000 around track. Busy does not mean poorly sorted.

I don't see how you can tell that it's too stiff from the video either. Those are some quick laps for a car with ""only"" 300hp; quicker than the GT3's time that day.

Honestly, the in lap videos looks fairly similar to how someone would  get a well setup square S2000 around track. Busy does not mean poorly sorted.

Only reason to get one is if you want a widebody in my opinion.  If you just want B5 wagon to rally around in I'd get an A4 or an S4 that's already here in the states.  Save a ton of money that you can spend on parts.",Neutral

"Si was really a great car. Peppy around town, amazing chassis, lightweight, great mpg, excellent gearbox and plenty of space. Took my family of four on multiple road trips. It is great for what it is at that price point. 

The FL5 is a step up in aggressiveness for sure, bit stiffer suspension but still fine on comfort mode IMO. The rest of the car is just so much more dialed in and sharper. It feels special. Only you can determine if that is worth the 15-20k upcharge between the two. From a financial standpoint, I'm not sure it's justified to be honest.

"Yeah I have no desire to tune mine either. Car is already fast enough and imo this is not an engine where you want to try to eek out every last bit of horsepower. Keep it stock and healthy

Admittedly I bought the Ford Performance springs mostly for looks. They dropped the ride height about 3/4 inch. It did make the ride a little stiffer but nothing jarring or uncomfortable. I want to say it rides better through corners but that could be placebo and I did the springs nearly 2 years ago and don’t really remember how the car felt on the stock springs anymore. Word of caution though, lowering the GT350 makes the front end a frequent scrape risk. It happens all the time to me, especially since I’m now running a 30 profile tire vs 35. I just live with the scrapes as they arent visible from the front and its a plastic splitter

The wheels on paper dropped 40 lbs of unsprung weight. I didnt get a chance to test the car properly before and after as I bought and put on the wheels as the car was coming out of winter hibernation. The car feels a bit more nimble on turn in though, as its lugging less weight around. Was it a monumental change? On the street, no. My primary reason for getting wheels was to change up the look and so I could put on PS4S rubber. The super sports are no longer in production and Michelin didnt make the PS4S in the OEM GT350 size with that 35 profile sidewall. My car currently runs PS4S in the GT350R oem size. The other benefit is at some point I want to upgrade to a GT350R and these wheels will carry over as my street set. I’d keep the carbon wheels with cup 2s as a track set

The springs and wheels are incremental changes on an already fantastic car. To me they are worth it because of the sum of their benefits (looks and performance). If you’re going strictly for performance gains, its probably more worthwhile to spend the money on track days and improve yourself as a driver. Although on track, the lighter wheels will make a difference. The biggest difference between stock GT350 and GT350R is the wheels and tires",en,"Yeah I have no desire to tune mine either.

"Safari cars are a functional homage to rally cars rather than some half-assed battlewagon. There is a difference and it should be gatekept.

My guess is that the higher lift to fit bigger tires was simply due to rally tires not being DOT legal and needing to clear whatever they could get at the time. I'd like to see a transition to smaller tires so it opens up the possibilities.

So, maybe a Mk1 Escort? Datsun 510? Datsun 240Z? Ford Capri? Alpine A110? Hawk Stratos replica? Custom Locost build in the vein of the Ariel Nomad, but lighter? Non-impact-bumper 911? '64-69 Mustang (has Monte Carlo history and can draw on Falcon history as well)?

The 911 is unique in that it's a relatively flat floor and has a rearward weight bias so it's naturally suited for rough terrain. They're also pretty stout and can fit 29s under the fenders.",en,"Safari cars are a functional homage to rally cars rather than some half-assed battlewagon.

There's no more soul in duct tape than leather (and there's far more soul in worn, lived-with leather than new leather). There's nothing to be proud of if your spring rate and damping rate lead to a never-ending bouncing over expansion joints and changes in road surface.

"Yeah I keep trying to convince my parents to let me buy a rough classic (240z, Opel GT, Karmann Ghia, 510, 944, etc etc) and store it at their place for the next decade until I have a garage or spare spot, but no dice.

I’m gonna have to settle and “restore” something from the early 2000s by then. Maybe I’ll save a blob eye wrx or EK hatchback. Or build an Outlaw style 986 lol

Edit: ok an outlaw 986 would be hysterical, even if dumping 15k+ of parts and work into a 986 is a fools errand

Lower it, blend the side scoops, nice exhaust and mild diffuser. Speedster windshield. Soft top delete. Blended ducktail spoiler. Fifteen52 outlaw wheels.

Exhaust, plenum and TB on the 3.2L S engine. Coilovers. Lightweight flywheel, brakes, etc.

Apparently being rich means you are above the law. He basically admits, or at least implies, that the accusations are true. No idea how Porsche hasn't distanced themselves from this asshole, but instead made a PR film with a criminal.  

The entire report is worth watching, highly interesting stuff. 

Edit: The charges for this trial were 15 cases of assumption of authority. He was accused of persuading an  employee of the vehicle registration office, into registering a bunch of cars for him. 

The connection came to light after the police caught a thief, and subsequently went through his mobile phone. The phone records lead them to a garage owned by Erik Brandenburg. There were a ton of photos, including VIN numbers, on said phone. The owner of a stolen Porsche recognized his vehicle, and made a connection between the image film made for Erik Brandenburg, and his stolen vehicle. 

So he investigated the location the promo had been filmed at, and found a hangar that Brandenburg had rented. Outside said hangar laid 6 stripped out Porsches, or what was left of them. The shells were all missing their identification numbers. In Germany you can not send a vehicle to the scrapyard without those numbers, and the appropriate paperwork that is connected to the vehicle. The shells disappeared before the police could get a hold of them. 

**Can anyone check my translation of this last part? Not sure if i got it quite right.**

He then proceeds to ask the interviewer if he has ever stolen a bicycle. The interviewer says he has never done such a thing.

He is then asked to explain his previous statement, and simply responds that he means exactly what he just said.

That being said, a 911 is just a lot of parts.  All the cylinder jugs are seperate, and the case is 2 parts.  So for the jugs, and case (12+2= 14 parts) on a v6 you would have ONE part.  Repeat for the heads, on a V6 you have 2 parts.  On a 911 you have 6 heads, then the cam towers and 2 sets of valve covers on each side, then oil return tubes, there are just so many sealing surfaces and so many parts.

However.... they weren't always stupid money.  Up until 5ish years ago, pricing was relatively sane, but then rich old guys ruined everything.",Positive

"Someone on here once said that offroad packages are wastes of money because 99% of people's driving is onroad and doesn't need it.

That got me thinking.

I've got a half dozen friends who live near me (Maine, urban area, about 1.5hr from the nearest backcountry) and who drive cars with some offroad capability (two Crosstreks, one Outback Wilderness, one old-ass Rav4, one Maverick, one older Pilot). 

I decided to poll them (because being friends with me is *so annoying*) about their offroad use.

They all basically said the same thing, which is that they need mild offroading abilities to go camping about 2 times a year, go hiking 2-3 times a year, and most of them go on 1 big backcountry trip per year (4-6 days - going up to Baxter, going hunting, or being drunk as hell in a cabin and saying that you're hunting. #maine). 

Now, some of these trips might only require like 15 minutes of offroad driving. And that includes like a weeklong trip if you just leave your car at the trailhead the whole time. But they're still trips where mild offroad driving is needed.

I'm going to call that 10 days per year where they need a vehicle with moderate offroad chops.

Near me, it costs about $100 per day to rent a small SUV. It's about $150/day to rent a Wrangler, but I think they could mostly get away with Ford Explorer Or Similar.

So for each of my friends, having a mildly offroad-capable vehicle will save them about $1000 per year.

It'll also save them the need to deal with a rental car, and the possibility to not finding one available (this is Vacationland, this definitely happens).

The average American will own their car for 8 years. So over that period, they'll use that offroad package for about 80 days total - saving them $8,000.

Most offroad packages don't cost that much.

Which I think means, they kind of make sense - even if you don't use them very often.",en,"Someone on here once said that offroad packages are wastes of money because 99% of people's driving is onroad and doesn't need it.

"Yeah the Raptor has thousands of dollars worth of revised suspension components to support the lift.

I really don't understand how this cross shop is so confusing to you. We were looking at vehicles that hauled 4 people for under $35k. For that money you got a loaded interior and AWD Bronco Sport. In the Ranger you got a 2WD pretty basic truck. 

That same math doesn't work out when the Bronco Sport Sasquatch is $45k. At that price we would have bought the Ranger (or a decent spec fullsize Bronco).

Tire clearance to the strut was limited, which meant the wheel/tire assembly needed to be spaced out, which meant the front fenders would have to be hacked away.

Tire clearance to the rear fender/quarter was limited, which meant the wheel/tire assembly would rub the inner fender under compression. I'd have to cut out the quarter panel to resolve the inner fender issue adequately (i.e. to ensure it was sealed against mud and water), and would have to clearance the quarter to clear the tire as well.

Bump travel was limited, which meant either reengineering the front end or having a compromised car.

The lifted car would need a steering rack drop, preferably handled by dropping the subframe. This would change force distribution into the framerails, requiring them to be reinforced.

The lifted car would also need a rear subframe drop, which would again change force distribution.

All for what? To have something I could drive fire roads with but otherwise be completely and totally compromised? To do something that any number of stock SUVs and pickups could do, without worry of underengineering and failure?

Others may find it fun to build something that's not great at any one thing, but I just get annoyed. Street cars for the roads I like should be narrow, feelsome, relatively soft but well-damped, lithe, and fun. Overlanding builds should have payload and capability, but only need so much capability because in the US, overlanding involves a lot of pavement work. Off-road builds for high-speed desert use are different than off-road builds for rock-crawling are different than off-road builds for mud, all of them compromise street usability. Track cars should compromise almost all on-road manners in search of lap times, and dedicated time attack cars shouldn't have any pretense of on-road manners.

"I mostly agree with you. I feel like there’s multiple factors behind the decline of auto shows, but Covid was definitely the killing strike. 

The other problems were that
1.) cars have gotten so expensive and unaffordable that it’s killed off hope for potential customers. Years ago people used to see more affordable options and aspire to own them. Even if you were a working class dude, you could see some cars and trucks that you could see yourself owning one day. Now even basic family cars are $40,000, and that’s before options and the inevitable dealer markups. And 

2.) They keep killing off fun and interesting cars. At the NYC Auto Show last year, it was a sea of plain ass crossovers. Who wants to go to a premier auto show like the NYC Auto Show to go see…a Honda CRV? I might as well have just gone to the local car dealerships in my town.

Non removable second row seats, no comment here. Just wtf??!! This is what we buy a minivan for.

"It's not as straightforward as it seems. The system is patented, to start with, so any manufacturer wanting to use a similar system would have to license that from FCA.

Secondly, the Stow-N-Go seats are not as comfortable as most minivan middle seats because they have to be narrower and shorter so they can fit in the floor bins.

There's probably also some penalty in NVH and torsional stiffness because of the big holes in the floor.

Those bins also make it more difficult to route the exhaust, and probably limit break-over angles, too.

All things considered, other makers have had plenty of time to consider copying Chrysler's design, and since all of them have passed, it's probably safe to say that the tradeoffs were not worth it to other manufacturers.",en,"It's not as straightforward as it seems.

"It's somewhat sarcastic, but also mostly true. 

The F-150 that I test drove had a $62k sticker price marked down to $54k since it was a prior year demo model (1 year old, 7k miles, but technically ""new""). The 550i I bought was 3 years old with 45k miles, but was a CPO that already had the extended warranty and extended maintenance plan included (6 years / 100k for essentially everything except tires). So even though it was ""new"" vs ""used"", the BMW actually had essentially a 3yr/55k warranty *and maintenance plan* vs the F-150's 3yr/36k warranty. The BMW was very specific since I was looking for a 550i with the B&O sound system and could only find 3 in the entire state of Texas for sale. This one had *extremely* bad swirl marks all over the black paint which let me get it at a discount ($37k with an $80k original sticker at only 3 years old), so I took it straight to a fantastic detailer as soon as I picked it up and spent close to $1k on a multi-stage paint correction. They had my car for 5 days doing all of the work, but it looked like a showroom new car when I got it back except for a light blemish area on the rear bumper that is only visible if the light hits it a certain way.

So comparing sticker price to sticker price, my car was more expensive ($80k vs $62k). But the actual amount I paid ($38k vs $54k) with equivalent warranty coverage, all of the maintenance pre-paid, a loaner car every time I take it in, etc. was significantly less. I'll sell it right around the 3yr mark and I expect the depreciation to be roughly the same on both vehicles at that time (BMW at ~$18k and F-150 at ~$35k). 

So the BMW was 30% less expensive up front with a lower overall cost of ownership. Trucks don't get completely fucked by depreciation like luxury cars do, so you can't get those kind of deals on a current-gen lightly-used truck.",en,"It's somewhat sarcastic, but also mostly true.

",en,">For 10k you actually get quite a good number of options though

Yea you can, but those should be standard on a $90k car. Porsche is a huge ripoff when it comes to options and I don't think anyone will disagree. The 911 comes with practically nothing. To get a leather interior on a $90k car it shouldn't be a $4k option, a premium stereo should be standard and not a $3k option, heated seats with memory should be standard not a $4k option... Here are some of the more absurd ones

"Well, they could go down the route of Ferrari and Lamborghini and simply make the point of entry higher, but what would that improve? If they gave you all of the good stuff as standard, the starting price would rise correspondingly.

Frankly, I like the way they're doing it. While their cars aren't cheap, they're much more affordable than some of their rivals. With Porsche I can prioritize and decide that I value leather interior over a high-end audio system, or a sports exhaust over the crazy 18-way seats. I'd hate it if I had to spend 100k to get my hands on a Porsche just because it has a nice audio system or an outdated navigation system as standard.

With their current system I can take a Cayman or Boxster, slap an exhaust (~3k), the bose audio system (1k) and the 14-way seats (2k) on it and be good to go for around 60k. Let's be realistic and add a few of the smaller options like heated seats or a nicer steering wheel and you'll end up with maybe 65k in total. You'd probably have no chance of getting a new Porsche at that price point if they had all the stuff you've mentioned as standard.

Again, I'm not saying their cars are cheap, but you have to look at it the other way as well.

"So, you're unlucky in this.  The '76 Grand Safari was kinda unique, it was the largest car GM built at the time, and it was on a kinda oddball chassis (C-body).  Its got leafs instead of coils out back, which isn't going to rule out suspension upgrades, but is going to make them a little off the beaten path.

First thing to do is clean it, clean it well. This will reveal if the frame is rotted beyond repair or, if you have a solid foundation.  It'll make it look a lot better, and it will also show what if any interior bits need replaced.  Second order of business is getting it in good running order.  Both the 400 and 455 engines have a decent aftermarket so you shouldn't have any problems there.  

Once its clean, runs, and drives, then consider what you want to change.  Wheels are an easy add, as is window tint, a decent set of headlights, etc.  The most expensive and hardest to swap to modern stuff is going to be all the door panels, dash, plastics, etc.  ",en,"So, you're unlucky in this.

"I'd start with leaving it stock.  Cleaning it up.  Do maintenance work.  Change the oil, coolant, brake fluid, power steering fluid, plugs, wires, cap, rotor, transmission fluid, diff fluid, grease all the zerk fittings, check the suspension and brakes, check the lights.  Make sure the tires are good.  Go over the car and figure out what you want out of it.  IMO, if it is a 95%+ stock vehicle and you just want to change everything on it, you might be better selling it and buying something else.  If you tune it up, do mostly stock replacements, a few upgrade, you could easily get it running better than it did off the showroom floor.

Some things you will want to consider -

How much time and money do you want to spend on this?  What do you want - Original, good DD, show car, race car?

What do you want to do with the engine?  Leave it?  Rebuild it?  Crate motor?  LS Swap?  Carb or EFI?

Transmission - Leave it?  Put in a rebuilt one?  Swap to a 700r4 or 4L60e?

Suspension and Brakes - Leave whats there and replace it as it breaks?  Replace it all with stock parts?  What swaps? What is available in the aftermarket?

Body - Leave it and clean it up good, or repaint?  How much do you want to spend on a paint job?  Trim, lights, seals, glass.

Interior - How much do you want / need to upgrade and replace?  I wouldn't be surprised if you could find stock replacement parts out there.

If you look around, I'm sure you can find replacement parts for most stuff.  Certainly engine, transmission, suspension stuff.

"As a mom of two, I absolutely LOVE my Mazda 5!
It’s was perfect for a family of 4 to haul kids and stuff and the occasional play date friends and even the dog. It was zippy, easy to drive and park and had exactly the perfect amount of room I needed with the versatility of the 3rd row. I loved the sliding doors. I really wish there was a replacement for it. If there was an electric version, I’d buy it in a heart bear!

I just don’t understand why the European market has so many options in the range and US does not. The US/NA families have the same practicality needs as the European families. 

The average family does NOT need some giant off-roading SUV. We just want to haul kids, groceries, and the occasional friends around town with ease. 

I feel the whole minivan mom “stigma” was marketing created. I absolutely LOVE my sliding doors. They are so convenient in so many ways. And the whole push for giant SUV seems also marketing created. I don’t know a single family that goes off-roading in their SUV. Most other moms I talk to just want an easy to drive and park, great mileage, people hauler that is easy to get in and out. ",en,"As a mom of two, I absolutely LOVE my Mazda 5!

"No literally. The reason so many manufacturers are even building “sportier and overlanding” stuff is because of car reviewers. 

Albeit I watch them. But they’re so fixated on “luxury and sporty” bruh most people just want comfy and good. We don’t want too many bells and whistles. A basic kei van or a hatchback designed car is good enough for 50% the population (being conservative)

Most people if they had the option to buy a smaller but ample space car, I’m sure they would. I don’t have facts to back this up. But I can presume people love station wagons, and would be happy with a liftgate design. Or even hatchback design.

"Which was far too much for a sub 3000lb sedan or crossover. They handled terribly for their era, .78G on the skidpad was not good for a 2950lb car with a 180HP 1.8L. Handling was ""fine"" for the base and perfect for the AWD but it wasn't engaging or good handling by any means. 

They actually handled quite well with a simple set of mild lowering springs and better shocks and tires. Shockingly better. Nobody on the planet was saying their base suspension Corolla was a good handling car though. They just weren't. Too tall. Too soft. 

Handling on the Celica, which shared the platform and engine, was excellent. It was a bit lower with a much lower effective CG. Pretty much everyone lowered those an additional inch or more to get the clearance around 4-4.5"". Stiffening up the springs to reduce roll was a critical aspect too, so you could maybe argue that the handling could have been much better just by stiffening up the suspension. 

Sadly it seems most of the Matrixes and Vibes finally bit the dust. It's been a long time since I've seen a Matrix XRS and don't see many base or AWDs anymore either.

"Every single half ton truck/SUV equivalent already has way more power than they need or could ever use.

"Subjectively speaking as an LX 470 owner with plenty of bias, I can’t envision myself ever owning a QX whatever.

This isn’t the direct fault of the Nissan taken in isolation, but the number one reason for me is the significantly better community and aftermarket support for Land Cruisers. I’m in a Land Cruiser club with ~50 people who know them in and out, and on top of that there are two specialist shops within an hour that mostly work on LCs that I can take my truck to. There are all kinds of aftermarket accessories, and it’s actually not uncommon to see other LCs and LXes around with snorkels, bumpers, lift kits, and so on. I don’t think I’ve ever seen an Armada or QX with anything beyond a Thule/Yakima basket on the roof.

I also feel like the previous gen Armadas/QXes were not there design-wise. Too many weird bulges, curves, and fender vents, and I don’t like the higher up door handle that’s more of a latch where the edge of the door meets the body. The latest QX actually looks really good, for what it’s worth.

If you’re just looking for a people hauler, you probably wouldn’t care about point 1 in the slightest, but since this is an enthusiast forum, the LX is definitely the better enthusiast vehicle, at least here in the US. I probably paid twice as much for my LX as I would have for an equivalent Sequoia, Armada, or QX, but I have zero regrets and I definitely feel like I got my money’s worth from the higher price of admission. The flip side is that the LX will hold its value better than the QX, so even though it’s more expensive to buy, it’s also worth more when you sell.",en,"Subjectively speaking as an LX 470 owner with plenty of bias, I can’t envision myself ever owning a QX whatever.

2010+: weekend track weapon, perfect daily, or stance mobile. Either way they're dope. 

The Honda Element was the butt of every joke at the dealership I worked at in the mid 00's. People love those things now.

Maybe I'm out of touch, but I don't see many tuned Audi's these days. Seems like I still see new(er) hooked-up BMW's, but few Audi's.

Where I grew up, Ford Probes were big... super polarizing, too. We always called them ""anal probes"". I saw one last week that looked shockingly mint... then the hatch blew open down the highway lol.

The Ford Focus was also cringey to us in the 00's. Domestic rice. The newer ones are obviously fucking rad.

As far as accessory trends and perceptions go, nobody gives a shit about vertical doors now. I still want a shit box with them because of course. 

Do minivans still come with screens in the headrests??? Seems a bit obsolete now with every kid having a tablet, but I'm not in the minivan market so I admittedly have zero clue. I suspect if it hasn't died yet, it will soon. 

Flame paint jobs/decals were always tacky af, but I see less and less of them. 

Paddle shifters are more acceptable, and reasonably so, as the tech has developed.

In general, I feel like driving strange, slow, but rare and quirky cars is seen as a little bit more acceptable within the greater car culture these days than it was years ago. Since everybody and their mother has seen videos of ridiculous power being put down in pretty much everything, the value of being unique - not just a nice paint job and wheels/power upgrades on the same car you've seen literally 10k times - but truly odd, quirky cars that few people even recognize is valued much more.

The Honda Element was the butt of every joke at the dealership I worked at in the mid 00's. People love those things now.

Maybe I'm out of touch, but I don't see many tuned Audi's these days. Seems like I still see new(er) hooked-up BMW's, but few Audi's.

Where I grew up, Ford Probes were big... super polarizing, too. We always called them ""anal probes"". I saw one last week that looked shockingly mint... then the hatch blew open down the highway lol.

The Ford Focus was also cringey to us in the 00's. Domestic rice. The newer ones are obviously fucking rad.

As far as accessory trends and perceptions go, nobody gives a shit about vertical doors now. I still want a shit box with them because of course. 

Do minivans still come with screens in the headrests??? Seems a bit obsolete now with every kid having a tablet, but I'm not in the minivan market so I admittedly have zero clue. I suspect if it hasn't died yet, it will soon. 

Flame paint jobs/decals were always tacky af, but I see less and less of them. 

Paddle shifters are more acceptable, and reasonably so, as the tech has developed.

In general, I feel like driving strange, slow, but rare and quirky cars is seen as a little bit more acceptable within the greater car culture these days than it was years ago. Since everybody and their mother has seen videos of ridiculous power being put down in pretty much everything, the value of being unique - not just a nice paint job and wheels/power upgrades on the same car you've seen literally 10k times - but truly odd, quirky cars that few people even recognize is valued much more. Street cred isn't earned by just having a nice, fast car, but by getting the most out of and loving niche stuff. It didn't used to be like that.",Positive

Its looks have never grown on me and it's never going to be considered pretty in any revisionist history that will ever be penned. But it's a great car. The engine has never felt lacking in power no matter what we load it with, it handles just fine for its size and weight, and that quirky sliding load tray is a genuinely brilliant feature.

We now live in an era where the default car for Americans is no longer a sedan - it's a crossover SUV. I'm going to throw my hat in the ring and say that the Aztek pioneered this class of vehicle. Sure, they didn't get the looks right, and super quirky features like the built in fold out tent (we sadly misplaced ours at some point) didn't get adopted into the mainstream. But the Aztek got the blend of car, minivan, and SUV correct.

Its looks have never grown on me and it's never going to be considered pretty in any revisionist history that will ever be penned. But it's a great car. The engine has never felt lacking in power no matter what we load it with, it handles just fine for its size and weight, and that quirky sliding load tray is a genuinely brilliant feature.

We now live in an era where the default car for Americans is no longer a sedan - it's a crossover SUV. I'm going to throw my hat in the ring and say that the Aztek pioneered this class of vehicle. Sure, they didn't get the looks right, and super quirky features like the built in fold out tent (we sadly misplaced ours at some point) didn't get adopted into the mainstream. But the Aztek got the blend of car, minivan, and SUV correct. It's a modern day VW Golf: not outstanding in any one area, but crucially it doesn't fall down in any one area either, and becomes quite the loyal and dependable companion for everyday use.",Positive

"I think this is well-deserved. When it was announced, there weren’t a ton of competitors — in particular, the NC Miata was as bloated as ever.

But then people started driving them and realized that they don’t feel like they have 200hp. In fact, you basically have to get headers and a tune to get rid of the torque dip. And the rev hang makes it less fun to row through the gears than people hoped. 

Then Nissan cut prices on the 370Z. And then the ND Miata came out, and it was faster despite having 40hp less. And then Mustangs got independent rear suspension, so they can actually handle (in addition to having a 0-60 in the fours). And then Toyota and BMW went in on the Supra, which means it wouldn’t even make sense to buy an 86 and turbo it. Every year it’s been on the market, it’s been a harder and harder sell at nearly $30k.

"To be fair the STI is clearly the weakest competitor in the current bracket between the RS, R, and Type-R. The RS and Type-R are significantly better track and performance cars, and the R is so much more refined and practical.

All that being said, the STI is still a completely viable option. But you have to be into the STI specifically, or prefer the driving feel.

"> If you want to grow a Youtube presence you have to make each episode a slam dunk

Absolutely incorrect. Look at the top Youtubers. They made their success with consistency (most of them upload something every single day) and quantity over quality. Quality takes a backseat to 'moar uplodes' on YT, and you can easily figure that out by reading comments on any video (though I wouldn't recommend that, for your sanity). The average person watching Youtube just wants more of what you're offering, instead of higher quality content. This is also very apparent with everyone clamoring for a video similar to the Miata one all the time... The key to youtube success has a lot more to do with mass-production than actually interesting content.

That said, I think RCR has done a tremendous job not sacrificing their quality for consistency.",en,"> If you want to grow a Youtube presence you have to make each episode a slam dunk

The winters can be pretty rough here in the mountains, and there are a decent amount of county roads that are 100% dirt and rough terrain, so it only makes sense that most people around here who dig cars are into Jeeps and Subies.

I've noticed a decent amount of VA's with even length headers and anti-lag in the springs, and a lot of clean eagle eye hatches and sedans as well. The GD's are more common in more rural areas, but it seems like the hawkeye GD is probably the rarest type no matter which environment you're in.

Jeeps are a lot more common in rural areas as you'd expect, but here, people take them to the next level. I'm not very knowledgeable on those but in some areas the older Cherokees and Wranglers even seem to outnumber Subies, and surprisingly they're not really mall crawlers either (Considering how expensive it is to live here in most areas, and how many midwest trust fund kids like to move here and jack up the rent)

Sure, you can get a panoramic sunroof on the higher trim level, but beyond that, there's really not enough here to objectively steal sales away from its less expensive counterpart. Maybe the exterior styling alone will sell it, who knows. If someone *truly* wants a fancy RAV4 though, why not just get the Lexus NX?",Neutral

"1) The color combo does not add desirability. If it did, the car would have sold for a lot more money than it sold for, and in much less time. The internet means every collector hears about virtually every car to come on the market. A G50 car this clean doesn't stay on the market for 3 months if this is truly a desirable (meaning value-adding) color. From what I hear, three people (two of whom were at Radwood) sent this car in for PPI's before I did, and then did not buy. The two of them approached me at the show with regrets (but not an offer to buy it off me now). 

2) It doesn't matter what you're doing with a car, whether it's collecting it, doing bolt-ons for street performance, or doing a rally build: all three of those customers want the same car. Stock, straight, no rust, no stories. Starting with a car like that means you save a LOT of money in the build. Rust repair could be tens of thousands. A tired engine could be tens of thousands. A shoddy interior is tens of thousands. A repaint is tens of thousands. There is nothing cheap about fixing a broken 911, especially if you're paying others to do the work. Just ask my friend Larry. 

Assuming a less-than-pristine example will be a lot cheaper than a pristine example, enough to to offset the cost of repairs, is a very dangerous gamble i have no interest in taking. Plus, all three ""has needs"" G50 cars I looked at, two in black and one in red, were both significantly shittier than this car, and also significantly more expensive (because black/black and guards red really ARE desirable color combos when it comes time to actually sell). They actually cost me almost $900 in PPI walk-aways. With this car, when sharky inspected it, he said ""this car is ace. the color is a little weird. But if you don't want it, i'm going to buy it myself."" That was good enough for me. 

3) Three people have decided I don't deserve to ""cut up"" such a nice car, and offered to buy it off my hands. When I gave the collector price, basically what a similar condition Black, white, gray, or silver car would cost,
 (because it's desirable, right?) they scoffed and low-balled me.

So itd be like this: air filter / intake head -> radiator -> supercharger -> intake manifold. Basically like [this](http://i.imgur.com/Rs3IDF6.png)",en,"Random idea i had reading your comment.

However, with a roots or screw-style supercharger, it's not so easy to bolt up a blow through system, so the most common way to do it is draw-through.

When it comes to drips or fuel pooling, the pressure is so high inside the supercharger that the air will still pull the fuel through, so it's not any issue really.

at the end of the day though, it's a very boring car to drive.  i almost feel frustrated thinking about how it may be a decade before the venza has a problem that gives me an excuse to get rid of it",Neutral

a balls to the wall escalade leases out around $1100.  the CTS-V is in the ball park.  Any other caddy is miles south of the $1500 pricetag.

what options will it have?  will it be loaded?  or will it be dealers choice?

So, while I would not reject the notion of having flexibility, the price doesnt work.  it would probably make more sense if you excluded the outlier models that are super expensive so you could get it more in line with the average vehicle.  or restrict the high end cars to 1 or 2 weeks a year for trips and such.

"With light modifications, every car is a rally car. That said, my personal pick for this is the Volvo XC70. Mostly because it’s just a tall v70, so if you lower it you have a great street car or if you put bigger tires on it you have a great off-roader/rally car. AWD and the five pot turbo are also tempting.

The biggest weakness  is that, in America, you can’t get them with a manual. But the Aisin AW55 GearTronic five speed auto is a pretty solid gearbox, and the manual shift mode is overall pretty good. And you can always swap in an M66 manual from a S60R or V70R, though that takes a bit of  tuning work also.

"A Ford Windstar is a flaming pile of garbage.  There's a reason Ford folded their minivan market years ago.  (LOTS of reliability issues)

Honda, Toyota, and Nissan will be out simply because you're not going to find them for $3,000 or less.  (Unless you're willing to buy a 15+ year old vehicle.)

Chevy and Mazda both have minivans in your price-range.  Say no to Chevy, they also exited the market for a reason, they were completely non-competitive.

So by default you chose between Mazda, Dodge/Chrysler and Kia.  You're looking at ten year old vehicles for all of these, so none are going to be the pinnacle of reliability.  Finding the one in the best condition, from any of these three, with the least miles is likely your best bet.

Our prices are usually higher than the auction houses on average because there's CRM and value attached to our services.

You're listing outliers and pretending they're common. They're not, and you're either being purposely disingenuous or just don't have enough knowledge on the subject to convey the market realistically.

I've been in the market since the late '00s. I watched the bubbles form in the marques I care about. I haven't seen them burst because they've been going up or stagnant.

Our prices are usually higher than the auction houses on average because there's CRM and value attached to our services.

You're listing outliers and pretending they're common. They're not, and you're either being purposely disingenuous or just don't have enough knowledge on the subject to convey the market realistically.

Everyone wants to believe this is some sort of pump and dump or money laundering when it turns out that there are just wealthy people out there who will pay huge money for good cars when they come up. It's a fucking mess to find a good car privately and then deal with the seller- auction houses and dealerships remove that hassle for a price.",Neutral
"I know ALL about Corvettes.

Whats funny is in 2019, I was going to buy a C7GS new for 69K, but started looking at 15-16 C7Z06 used for 50-55K, now you can't touch a base 14 Stingray for 50K, those same C7Z are 70K themselves. I should've pulled the trigger so hard on a C7Z. The other car I was thinking on at the time, Ferrari 360, is also somehow 20K more per average than 2019. 

At the time, I hadn't yet built my Evo or Mustang, which is why I held off, and now with them fully built, I'm ready for a new car, but I don't play with these prices for any reason. 

Again, fuck people.",en,"I know ALL about Corvettes.

"See, I dont even mean that guy's particular 308.

Because of this guy, every 308 is going to magically be worth more. Maybe even just the non steel bodied version ""because it wont rust if you safari it""",en,"See, I dont even mean that guy's particular 308.

"Right?

I can have a built 8500 RPM coyote Stang and a 700 hp 6266 Evo X....such as I do....or one Japanese car from the 90s with 160-276 hp for the same money. 

I can hold on to these MFs. They are newer and faster and don't come with 25 year car problems.",en,"Right?

"Unless you're at an auction in person (and even then, many celebrities send agents rather than attending auctions themselves), you're supposed to have no idea who buys what. That's how it works. That's even how BaT and CaB work- you only know the person's username, which could be 'ClownPenis.Fart' despite them being Bill Gates or Floyd Mayweather. That lack of transparency protects the buyer, regardless their intent. There is no reason why multimillionaire collectors should be outed simply because they're buying something. Don't like it? Tough. Start an auction house based on transparency and watch it wither and die on the vine.

That said, there *are* companies that purchase cars for investment purposes- but they're extremely few and far between. The vast majority of buyers are people who are either speculating while building a collection, building a collection because they need something to do, fulfilling a lifelong dream, or buying a car to drive and enjoy.

Again, I have literal firsthand knowledge that some of the highest prices paid for certain cars are 100% legitimate because I or someone I employ have been to the collections at private homes. While I have a financial interest in these cars going up, I also have the ability to pivot within the industry and wouldn't do collusive bullshit because it's just not necessary to make good money. You can become rich catering to the rich without selling your soul.",en,"Unless you're at an auction in person (and even then, many celebrities send agents rather than attending auctions themselves), you're supposed to have no idea who buys what.
