The eco mode range is with AC?
"Range in eco mode - 550
Range in city - 450
Range in sport - 320

If ac temperature is 25 and ambient temperature is 28-31

In hot areas range is further reduced

Use more ACC it uses more Regen and less brakes

Wet mode will not use regen"
Can other owners who have completed certain kilometres let us know the similar stats too?
How much % ACC YOU USE?
Thats very less
"I‚Äôm driving RWD 75 ( empowered) .. 2300 KM sofar

For RWD 75kwh also?
"Yes, I have"

No
Yes they would come. But you need permission from apartment RWA for installation of charger. Has anyone else installed ev charger in your society?
Does electric person from tata comes to home for feasibility of charging station at our apartment for briefing

Always ask for pdi before confirming delivery‚Ä¶ thats a norm now
No refund .. no return .. deaf ears
And this is what they have done
They said they do pdi internally
I was there with my two small kids who had to wait for 4 hrs due to this
No information on pdi
No ..
Which city btw?
Dint they call you for a PDI prior to delivery?

Why do you need seat covers?
Quick query - As we have ventilated seats in front. Seat covers can be used only in the rear. Won't that feel weird with two different colors front and rear and any idea how to manage this.

Which variant ?
did anyone get the seat cover for Harrier EV in Hyderabad. It seems tata genuine accessories doesn‚Äôt have it yet and off market is also not available. Anyone has any leads?

Some people tells that they have not faced any issues with their Tata cars(lucky ones) but there are many other bad experiences with their purchases. (Its 50-50%)

Please help me with the decision to buy Harrier ev or not.

Thank you"

"My review on RWD after 1200kms:
1. Amazing suspensions
2. Amazing handling
3. Regen is low when SOC > 90. Don't use Regen as brakes in this zone.
4. Consistently getting a range of 550. ACC is the key.

I found my dream car!

Very happy with the performance and efficiency."

"Done 1000 kms in 12 days..fearless 75..

Range around 490 ...various modes tried..around 4 people in car mostly..

Idle time also high as had to learn ev arcade etc..
One or two issues ..very minor after update..
Side view mirrors were not opening..but were closing after I opened them mechanicaly.
Called Fairdeal motors jammu..
They promptly promised PD..but next day morning when i got into car, it automatically worked ..
Don't know what the issue is..may be software issue..
But that remain with automatic vehicles..
A friend  have xuv 700 which he says ..seat has stopped auto posting on getting in..

"Hello Everyone,

I‚Äôd like to share my driving experience with the Harrier EV Empowered RWD so far. Till date, I‚Äôve driven around 1,600 km, and I‚Äôve noticed that the efficiency is gradually improving with time.

On the latest run, after charging through a 7.2 kW AC charger, the car managed 260 km at just 50%( 100% to 50%) charge. This was with full-time AC ON, driving mostly solo in Delhi NCR‚Äôs heavy city traffic, in City Mode, and keeping regeneration at L2.

Based on this, I‚Äôm now quite confident that the Harrier EV can easily deliver over 500 km on a full charge under similar driving conditions."

"If he books now, he will get his vehicle only after second update."

"Ok, icici costing around 600 for 3 yr I think I would keep this as well"
This is what the dealer told me

I think lifetime RSA is provided by Tata for EVs
Could anyone please comment on which of the add-ons are unnecessary? That would be greatly appreciated.
Is that right value or costly? This is from policy bazar..

"Hello all,

We recently visited Hong Kong and did a deep dive into the ASEAN EV Market. We analyzed EV Adoption, policies, charging infra across Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Philippines.

There‚Äôs interactive charts in this article :)

We also see where India is lagging and where it is leading the ASEAN and global market.

Why did you remove the positive terminal?

Can any owner share back of the car ?
When door is opened vechicle should not move

"Yes, however govt subsidy policy wasn‚Äôt limited to specific model, it‚Äôs for all EV. He played with the sentiments üòï No worries, I did my part, escalated to Tata motors, if not actioned, will check with other dealers. But won‚Äôt go with this dealer."
https://youtube.com/shorts/c3-1aNz4JQM?si=m04tzgyHEgM_FVT3
The dealer played safe... Harrier EV is not there in this advertisement... So he only gave verbal commitment
My dealer answers all the generic queries but keeps mum when it comes to update on the vehicle‚Äôs availability.
Thanks Lakshya.. yes I‚Äôll do some sort of complaint atleast they can‚Äôt use such banner
"My dealer upfront told me...subsidy chances are less as only first 10k customers will get subsidy and harrier has waiting so by the time you get delivery 10k registration would be done. I booked in July 2nd week. 
If this dealer told you in August then he knew you won't get subsidy. You should complain about him"
I‚Äôll log a complaint to tata motor today late evening when free from office work in written with all these‚Ä¶
üôÅ
"Sir pls read above,, they made a joke and fool me and might be many more"
"And biggest lie was this, have booked on 8th august and today sales person has revealed, you will not get subsidy.. leave the gold coin,  subsidy bhi nahi..

I asked him, you did used guaranteed word and made me fool..

I‚Äôll be cancelling from this dealer atleast and will rethink all"
You should ask the dealer to give in writing that the portable charger will not be included
That I don‚Äôt know. But Yes could be or what else be the reason
"Yes
What is he doing with those chargers though? Selling it separately?"
"Seems they have lot of bookings and don‚Äôt care much, not behaving good, lying to customer upfrontly..üôÅ"

I bought EMPOWERED 75 RWD with ACFC and i got both 7.2 and 3.3 kw charger
I downloaded by using mobile data only
Using wifi
BTW what is the data cap provided?
"No, it is not the case. My alexa works, it plays music but apps in ira and ira itself is not working. It didn‚Äôt work even once since it got activated"
Which version you own or yet to get the delivery?
"If someone have same version delivery, can also clarify. And one more thing, there will be manual with vehicle which can clarify what officially comes with specific model?

Can someone comment who has already got the delivery"
Okay
No ev can be sold with portable charger
Govt mandated charger of 3.3kw is must
He is lying
Chat with dealer sales person
"Hi, I got the reply from the dealer, that Empowered 75 AWD ACFC , will get only 7.2 kw fast charger not the portable 3.2 kw only, am not satisfied with the logic.. 3.2 kw is the default one..

@all , did anyone received above same version delivery, pls clarify and help"
"Jokes on your mindset. Owning two harrier EVs and the third one on the way, I will sell your registration plate number to earn cheap cash? Speaks volumes of yourself. Anyway, the community won't stop growing, cry more. I sincerely intended to keep only the owners by keeping spammers and scammers away."
"I think the mobile internet speed isn‚Äôt enough for the download, so it needs Wi-Fi. Try downloading your apps over Wi-Fi."
The e-sim coming with the infotainment got a data cap. May be you exceeded it
Anyone have installed back bumper safe guard and truck mat
Have you installed these apps using wifi or the built-in internet?

Any other suggestions for a smooth experience?

P.S. I had to get the RTO done today to catch the last day of the subsidy! Thanks for any help!"
I shall ping you separately.
Your apartment must have a charging station. Doesnt it?
AC one outside I have to stay for 8 hours
Ac one
There is one beside thub
4:1 ration should be maintained
"What will be impact if we charge only with DC / 60Kw charges? Without AC chargers , it‚Äôs costly but no option"

"I am planning to switch diesel version may be XUV700 , as charging always need to do outside"
R u in hyd ?
Thats a big problem
Yes.... This is an issue....
Thats damn low
As per my calculations 400
Also I can‚Äôt install AC chargers due to new policies brought in apartment community suddenly
How much did u get
Close to 500
Charging gun issue is persistent
They will get sorted out in some time . Most of the cars have problems in the initial phase
What's real world range are you expecting?
Software issues
What issues ?
I am not happy with vechicle range and issues
"It‚Äôs just a forwarded message from one of my friends‚Äô groups. I guess it‚Äôs a review post about a new car, but I‚Äôm not sure."
Yes
What is your expectation?
How many kms on the odo?
Is this the fearless variant?
Having 340 kilometres of range left at 53% battery is impressive for such a large vehicle like the Harrier.
What is the asking price?
Why selling HeV?

"Working fine on the app shows online and ready , keeps tripping with error 308 lock pin fail error noticed by ev"
This charger doesn‚Äôt seem functional
On call right now with the harrier ev owner who is stranded car not charging
Photo from mebz
Like at 20% you should be near a charging gun
I am not ready to take that risk yet! üòÄyou have to plan properly with plenty of time to do that
We have to reset the trip meter and do 100-20%
10kms in that speed in highway at 90% battery shows range of 400. City mode with AC on.
Has any Harrier EV owner done a highway mileage test at around 80-85kmph and checked the range?

Can we update ourself or we need to visit SC ?
I don‚Äôt see any changes though

No. I got it updated last week to next version
Yes got it yesterday
Is this is latest version ?
Yes there is no road tax in Telangana
Yes I bought one week ago
I guess from 2026 they may implement similar tax as karnataka
"So no 1.5 lac of subsidy from the government, seems its state govt plan only not central"
That‚Äôs applicable here in MH too with provision of subsidy as well
"In my case, dealer is not guaranteed for the subsidy, said only first 10k EV vehicles will get this from government"
In Telangana no road tax is the subsidy
"It‚Äôs Sai baba Auto mobile, Kalewadi, Pune. 
Ok @All Owners- have you guys received the subsidy of 1.5 lacs on EV vehicles ?"
Guests who got in for long drive appreciated the rear headrest.
"Rear seat dont have any recline option, it is fixed"
"It‚Äôs good unless you are very tall. If too tall, under thigh support may be an issue"
"May be you didn‚Äôt understand my answer right. I said, I am not seeing the issue you mentioned regarding parking assist causing any bugs for blind spot cameras. 

However, while in park assist camera mode, if you turn on indicator - it will disable 360 view and switch to blind spot cameras. It is very consistent, so I dont think it is a bug, but vehicle prioritizing blind spot cameras over 360 degree view while indicators are on"
But agree these things should have been refined if its a 30 L car
Same with Infotainment
In my current car Astor i see same.issue side mirrors dont open when unlocked i then switch off wait for sometime and then unlock it and start it back
Hmm
These are annoying for 30L vechicle
"As I didn‚Äôt seat on back no personal feedback 

Family said they are comfortable 

Software glitches sometimes they are critical 

Parking cameras and sensors suddenly stopped during tight parking 

Sometimes side mirrors don‚Äôt after unlocking, I have to do trail and error methods"
That's main thing i noticed but not sure as i didnt sit for long
Got it software bugs not critical then how about rear seat comfort/inclination
"Collecting critical info like chasis number haha hows is it contributing towards building community,  as i saidgood luck to u and people sharing info, i think u r new to joining community/groups, i have been part of many groups and no one asked chasis number haha, even registration number also u can happily sell it to third party anyways good luck to bakras"
May be
That's what this guy was trying to do. Maybe you didn't get my question bro.
There is no logic in my personal point view .. buying top end not using features ..
"Maybe you should get the terms right. If it helps the members and contributes towards building a community, I would love to be a sycophant."
"Say you select blind spot camera feed to be shown in instrument cluster display instead of infotainment screen. But it will revert back to infotainment after few trips. Like that, many preferences we set get reverted back to default frequently"
"I don‚Äôt have that issue, as long as doors are closed and indicators are off."
"Software issues are main problem with car and also when you switch on front camera under park assist after few some times blind spot camera etc., will not work"
What are those inconsistencies about the features you care about ?
The glitches are mostly with software part. Hardware seems to be perfect. Software glitches can be resolved by them step by step
"Overall happy. Minor glitches are there on features I don‚Äôt care about. There are inconsistencies in features I care about as well. But drivability is super, range is good, build quality and panel QC is good."
Yes I brought
"Taking chasis number, god knows to whom he will sell, now a days data is very dangerous, anyways good luck to people getting subscribing to it, as long as things are k its k once these goes out of hand thats where its becomes interesting and there is no one to blame as well üòÄ"

450+ with city mode is good..
"My first test around 400-420 , Emp 75 RWD"
I haven‚Äôt done a proper range test. But from the charging patterns against distance covered + range shown - it‚Äôs between 450 and 500 on city mode with some traffic.
"1000, out of which a 750km long drive. I am from Kochi"

What is the range u r getting??
How many kms have you done till now? And can I know which city are you from?
Your right
"I tried to simulate this situation. Door opening will immediately do:
1. Stop summon mode
2. Disengage auto hold
3. Engage park brake

If the third step is done, this accident wouldn‚Äôt happen. BUT I have faced errors related to park brake software multiple times. So I suspect it happened here as well. To me, it always happened on incline - which makes me suspect the issue is related to decision conflict between auto-hold, hill-hold and parking brake."

"üëç Let‚Äôs make this Harrier EV flood-proofed for real-world Indian monsoons and occasional water crossings. Since it‚Äôs an EV, the strategy is different from ICE SUVs: instead of adding snorkels, the focus is on water sealing, electronics, and driveline protection.

üîß Harrier EV ‚Äì Mods & Precautions for Max Wading Safety

1. Battery & High Voltage System

IP67 pack is already sealed, but the weak points are connectors, service plugs, and underbody covers.

Add:

Rubberized underbody coating for the battery tray.

Silicone sealing / dielectric grease on exposed HV connectors (orange cables, inverter, motor connections).

Protective skid plate (stainless or aluminum) with drain holes ‚Üí shields from debris and pressure waves.




---

2. Motors & Differentials

Harrier EV AWD uses dual motors (front + rear). Motors and gear reduction housings usually have breathers like diffs.

Extend breathers with tubing routed to the top of the firewall or A-pillar.

Use hydrophobic filters (Sintra / Donaldson type) at tube ends to prevent water/dust entry.



---

3. Low-Voltage Electronics

ECUs, relays, DC-DC converter, on-board charger are often mounted low.

Add:

Splash guards / shields for wheel wells and underside.

Marine-grade heat shrink + dielectric grease on all low-voltage connectors accessible underbody.

Secondary sealing for the cabin air intake and blower motor (common ingress point in floods).




---

4. Cooling & HVAC

EVs use liquid cooling for battery/motors, with radiators/fans upfront.

Risk: fans throwing water into electronics.

Mod: Install a manual fan cut-off switch or fuse pull method for deep crossings (dealership-dependent, as it voids warranty if hacked).

Relocate or shield coolant reservoir breathers upward.



---

5. Cabin & Body

Renew door/boot rubber seals (Harrier EV is still based on ICE Harrier body shell, not Defender-level sealing).

Apply automotive weatherproofing grease to door seals ‚Üí prevents leaks.

Add floor pan plugs that can be removed post-fording to drain water quickly.

Use hydrophobic cabin filters to protect blower from splashes.



---

6. Recovery & Tyres

Fit rated recovery points front + rear (factory EV recovery points may not be strong).

Use synthetic rope winch (sealed motor) ‚Üí steel cable corrodes faster in floods.

All-terrain tyres with aggressive tread help in soft riverbeds.

Maintain tyre pressure slightly lower (~28‚Äì30 psi) for better flotation in muddy streams.



---

7. Driver SOP (as important as mods!)

Always engage AWD mode + Terrain Response (if provided).

Enter slowly (2‚Äì5 km/h), build a gentle bow wave.

Never stop midstream ‚Üí water pressure can enter seals.

After exiting:

Run brakes lightly to dry pads.

Check underbody for trapped debris.

Inspect diff/gear oils if repeatedly crossing >500 mm.




---

üèÜ Harrier EV After Mods ‚Äì Wading Ranking

Stock: 600 mm (best EV in India).

With above mods: Safe, reliable use up to 650‚Äì700 mm (beyond this, electronics risk grows).

For comparison:

Force Gurkha (diesel + snorkel): 700 mm.

Fortuner/Hilux (diesel + snorkel + breathers): 800 mm.

Defender OCTA (factory engineered): 1000 mm.



So: the Harrier EV can be pushed close to Fortuner-level wading with mods, but not to Defender extremes. Its strength is sealed battery IP67 + AWD traction, weakness is electronics placement and cooling fans"

Xev9es panels get easily damaged and bent and dented
Xev9e is a soft car and has to be treated gently
But Harrier is also good if you want a safe solid car to make sure you go over bad roads and no roads and flooded roads
Makes it on par with international battery electric vehicles
Xev9e has battery pre conditioning for delhi and cold places as well
Plus the additional 5 kw battery capacity with blade battery's make it more thermal efficienct as well
Offcourse this is just one of the many things
May be it has something to do with weight of car
"Xev9e was desighned from the ground up as a family luxury electric long range vehicle for highway and city, the panels and materials and thickness of metals and combinations of aerodynamics thanks to the removal of limitations of an engine make the xeve desighn more efficienct for electrification"
"Means, tata has less efficient batteries and bms!!"
Harrier was desighned with fuel driven drive train and aerodynamics of a offroading heavy duty vehicle powered by fuel and it's efficiency
Born ev platform difference and efficiency of motors battery and bms
Why there is so much diff between range of xe9 and harrier ev

And one of them is definitely not going with Acko for your EV car

"Ok great you took delivery of empowered rwd,How your car is performing now. Ever thought came into you mind that you should go with QWD"
TataAIG not showing fearless 75 ev variant
"The risk is lower but yes the risk still exists, harrier also has mind bending 600 mm water wading so that also helps"
So acko will be good for harrier ev?
Since harrier EVs engine area unlike other EVs has a storage space and is sealed it's safe
So for harrier ev it is similar like other ICE car
Try not to aim forcefull jets of directed pressure onto any DC cables or input cable joints and clips
Wash the whole body no problem just don't wash the engine area (not applicable for harrier ev) or the underbody of the car where the dc cables go into the battery pack
What are your suggestions for ev car wash ?
For example you send the car for a car wash and they wash your underbody by mistake and the water jet is aimed at the breather cap of battery or your DC input cables then your gone without battery protection cover
Non accedental but still damaged due to unforseen circumstances not bearing manufacturing workmanship fault will not result in you getting warranty claim
I understand that if it is accidental damage we can claim with acko and if non accidental then with OEM am i right?
Two different things please don't mix up insurance for lifetime warranty
"WARRANTY = OEM PROVIDES COVER FOR ANY MANUFACTURING DEFECT ONLY

INSURANCE = TAKES ON THE RISK FROM THE OWNER INCASE THE ASSET IS DAMAGED DUE TO AN ACCEDENT OR CALAMITY or a consequence to the calamity with add on covers"
Kindly clarify - non accidental damage to the battery can be claimed with tata right? As they give lifetime warranty
You can take 3rd party as well all depends on the owner and how much risk he assess for himself and his situations
First year can I take ACKO and second year I‚Äôll go to hdfc
Anytime
Thanks

U can get in 10-15 days
I can provide the number Empowered  Rwd is easily available with them

They have ev specific service center in sector 14 right?

You mean easily available?

And which dealer?
When did you book?
I got mine on 23 july
M from Gurgaon RWD is equally available u can try from Gurgaon
Do explain in detail why
Only a few handfull of insurance providers for ev specific policys
No need of qwd
That's why I always say acko is not for EVs
""
I did ask acko n they said they dont cover non accidental or short circuit...
But when there is non accedental consequential damages to your electric system or short circuit or water ingress due to non flood and non natural calamitys then you are screwed royally
Especially for ice vehicles
Acko is very good for accedental straight forward cases
Could you please elaborate acko issue; I heard positive feedback about acko on this group
This is pathetic
In our other ev groups for all ev owners we have tied up with a central ev broking firm if you like you can take from there as well or you can do your own
Especially take battery protection cover
But yes what ever Insurance you buy make sure it's ev specific and don't go for acko
Your free to buy any insurance of your choice they can't force you
"Lol , during claim complication this same person will run away from you , nothing is in their hands they simply say all this for the 40 % commissions they make on insurance"

Highway safety at speed with loose and wet terrain better control safer breaking and handling and emergency manoovers
"You are kind of correct 

Its kind of adrenal rush it give us is so awesome"
"Yep

Tata EV cars are so powerful 

Tell me one ICE car which so powerful as QWD under 80 L"
Actually I don't know what is the benefits for go with QWD other than off roading that's why I am not able to convince myself
Even RWD is having more power than ice engine of safari/harrier then I don't think there are any need of more power for go to hilly area also
Since most of your highway and city RWD is more than sufficient
"First I booked fearless 75 but later due to many features missing in that shift to empowered with ACFC and now I am not able to convince myself for upgrade to AWD from RWD.

As AWD features are not attracting me for it"
Yep no doubt about it
Agree but I think RWD have enough power and some range benefits also

QWD is really great powerful car if you are visiting country/village roads
Hard plastic
To my knowledge
No not rubber
"I have not heard anything as additional cost of off-roading package 

Can any let me know in detail about this if you have come across

It will be of good help to understand what is off-roading packaging and also what and it‚Äôs included with price etc"
It is üëç
For offroading there is a off road package that you have to purchase seperately at a additional cost from tata motors it seems will also help in insurance claims if this package is taken plz note
Material looks very flimsy

This is underneath the charger gun what will happen if mud accumulates during offroading
""
"I living in Delhi NCR and not interested in off roading, i just want to know is it worthy to buy QWD, as dealer is saying Qwd he will deliver by next week but RWD will take time."
"That is subjective.
I personally like pristine white more than oxide."
Can anyone suggest which color is looking good on road prestige white or empowered oxide

Just what is your problem?
Why you want so much of everyone's attention?
And what is your obsession about posing as victim?

I asked for details of me harassing you on any chat, you shared none
And now whatever you do, you know, mask and be a man, what not

Why? Because like you I didn't respond to your vulgar messages on the personal chat
Because I didn't answer your uninvited calls 
And you talk about taking a stand"
I will not stand for what is wrong no matter what so you can try how much ever you want nothing will work
"No one has stopped you , you have my location and my number am not saying anything to anyone and running away like you and your accomplice"
Don't keep copying what I say it's very stupid
"Get a life
Stop being victim 
Do you think everyone is stupid to not see what is happening here?

And regarding me, I never asked for your details, you only posted the number on this group 
Still I didn't message you
And then you called multiple times on telegram 
Dropped vulgar messages 

And suddenly came here dropped shit about goons and vulgarity 
Deleted the personal chat

Wow"
"Nothing was deleted , what ever you did you have done why don't you remove the mask and show people how you really talk"
"Only thing I noticed is
You tried calling me multiple times
Dropped messages like have some balls in the person chat
And now you have deleted the personal chat before I could post here

And then come say that I sent you the vulgar messages and asked about goons 
Stop being victim

Share the proof now dude
Where that goon thing came from?
And why you deleted our personal chat?"
Theek theek hain try what ever you want does not matter
"So basically 
In your imagination 
I created a group and sent you vulgar things
And then deleted it?

And I sent some goons to you?
Where did that come from, share that also dude"
He also did the same thing today like you and ran away
"Haha hmmm if you would have kept it like a man i could have shared it , deleted it soo fast"
You can try buddy there's no harm
"Please share what I sent you?
Let me also know
And which group I created dude?"
All i can wish you is all the best üôè
Why dont you tell people here what you sent me like a coward on the temporary group you created sent all your threats and vulgarity and then deleted the group instantly
"Me sending goons to your place? How you came to the conclusion?
Did I ask any personal details about you?

Stop being the victim"
In the end you will realise that i was fighting for you guys only nothing more I have nothing to gain or loose with what ever you guys buy or sell or deside
Problem with people of today always crying victim
"@Indian718 I think it‚Äôs high time for you to ensure to take relevant action for a person who has come with his own agenda and disturbing the vibe of the group, if you are not taking relevant action I guess whole positive vibe in the group which use to be there will dilute and this will make people to take exit from this group

Is this the generation of men ?

Ok thank you for projected sales figures üëç under stood
By 2027 two wheeler EV sale is going to surpass two wheeler IC E and 2030 4 wheeler.

you can see in next two years
You might be aware that EV is going to surpass 5 % share very soon and as per global EV adoption once 5% adoption is suppressed then it is going to be exponential growth.
By that time.your car would be a write off
But not anytime soon
This will change with time
There are a few EVs who hold slightly better resale but negligible
2022 nexons are being sold for 3 and 4 lacs
EVs don't have any resale as it is praveen my 2021.mg zs ev profender edition for 28 lacs on 1st aug 2021 bought today dealers and resellers are offering me 6 lacs for the car with new tyres
What sir what about resale ?
Take Chevrolet or ford or harley davidson or any brand thats left india even today all their vehicles are serviced and well taken care of by the brand
Agree but there is uncertainty right.
why you are even recommending bro
Praveen they have been claiming uncertainty of these brands since years nothing has happened so far relax plus our government has a rule in place any automobile manufacturer for any models they launch here in india has to provide and stock parts and after sales service for 10 years minimum
BYD pump and dump policy
SAIC is existing India and jsw has no experience in manufacturing vehicles
You only said BYD and MG I hope you understand uncertainty of these brands ?
Do you know what actual work is ?
How does what you highlight show actual work
This can be a good start for you to start doing actual good work
Tell.me.what would be actual work according to you

But you are only 1
Why don't you put rest to your non sense also and start doing actual work instead of practicing baba giri

So your idea is the records ?
Am on most of the groups
Which several groups
Who is we
We are also active in several ev groups and have a idea what is happening.
Where is this issue reported for Curvv ev? Nexon EV 45?
There's one standing right now outside still not picked up
Based on what records who provided these records ?
Never heard it? Even samsung screens have it
Understood üëç
Oh it's a hinglish keybord
Uski respect bhi isse jyada hai
"Naah
My keyboard Stopped and said reply krke keypad ki bezzati mat kr"
"The actuator issue is not as big a problem as it‚Äôs sometimes made out to be, and it shouldn‚Äôt be a deal breaker. Based on records from the last 2‚Äì3 years, the number of cases has reduced after Tata introduced a small cover for the Nexon‚Äôs actuator.

It‚Äôs also not true that people were frequently stranded at chargers due to the charging gun failing to unlock. Most users now know how to unlock it manually, and help is readily available through various forums.

With the 2025 Nexon 45, Tata has started fully covering the actuator from the bottom. This prevents mud splashes on the actuator, which used to be the main cause of failures. The same cover is now also provided on the Harrier. The only trade-off is that reaching the actuator now requires removing the cover."
Did you seriously just type.that üòÇ your keybord must be crying in the corner
Spoon feed? You only said about feeding shit
What's taking you so long chat gpt checking what to reply kya ?
"Agree to what ? ""And offcourse a new come back ""üòÇ that's how a conversation goes my friend what you expect me to spoon feed your everything and just lay down ?"

Reliability and performance consistency in range again windsor wins
Windsor overall is not a better product than nexon 45 for sure
I've been helping windsor owners as well
It's not as bad as the nexon all you have to do is disable passive entry and then there are no issues
So we can't show that car as a better product than nexon. üòÇ
It's there on my channel as well have already posted this
"Your right and it's not the chargers it's the car itself that has issues with the software, charging protocols are the same"
"Windsor is facing lot of charging issues as many of the CPOS (including big ones) haven't programmed their chargers  for Windsor.  Inspite of selling so many thousand cars, m g has not done anything in this regard yet. People are getting stranded at many places. Open any Windsor owner group and you will find this. Aren't you aware of this?"
"No Mr Dhilip my suggestion would be to call ü§ô me so I can understand your exact use scenario for you and your family so we can pick the perfect car for your overall requirements and know what to expect from the decision we take together so that you move in knowing what your heading for and the compromises in certain areas that you will have to make, this applies to ice vehicles as well not only EVs also if the product itself is solid then the rest of the things can be taken care of...problems arise when product is also un reliable and non consistent in performance and quality and reliability and then on top of it you have to deal with bad after sales service as well"
really thanks for your suggestions but BYD and MG both future are uncertain in India.
"So Mr Meherab, ur suggestion is then for no Mahindra Tata EVs, no Hyundai Creta or KIA EVs if looking for safety, no MG BYD for a slight a bit of off roading. So wat are options left for us to take?"
BYD is not Indian road friendly as you mentioned before and MG is running scam with maintenance cost and rejections isn‚Äôt that true ?
my first criteria while even thinking of vehicles Is 5 star rating on crash test and stable body shell.
Why Hyundai and kia is not able to score 5 star safety ? Their creta still sells with 3 star sorry but I can‚Äôt spent 20 lacs who is not even crash tested.
"That‚Äôs what we wanted to avoid. People gets panicked, I personally know many who are using EVs without any issues. That‚Äôs why we were focusing on constructive feedback and like other  manufacturers Tata also has issues but it‚Äôs 70% hype and only 30% real so chillax."
Nice guy thanks buddy üòÄüëç
"i have finally decided to not go for any EV at all after all the feedbacks, kisi bhi company ki ho, kaun itna maatha fodi kare."

Do u know anything about hv critical error?
I see a huge difference in price compared to china and india if it is priced the same as china it would fall under the 25 to 28 L category. Also emax 7 mostly used as cab in China so that personal driving feel is missing. But it's a great car i have driven it
"Thanks i have driven emax7 initially i thought of buying it but few factors made me to rethink - 1 India vs china if something happens not sure byd will continue as tesla enters india there might be political drama and we don't want to be a victim in it. 2 - BYD is best in battery but driving doesn't give a good feel and features less, unnecessary import tax which falls on our pocket, also i don't need a 7 seater at this moment."
Thanks man.. Appreciate it
Perfectly said your on the right track
"Thank you for your kind words , üôè if you don't want to be troubled with frequent sc visits and be stranded then yes IF your frequent daily or travel roads are urban and semi urban then the Xev9e product is a better choice because mahindra has improved their service support for the electric vehicles compared to the tata vehicles at the moment , but for complete proven peace of mind before deciding on any product i.urge you to drive the BYD EMAX7 and the hyundai Creta ev for your requirements"
I'm not going to fix any time frame. Just gonna drive and when it's nearing below 25% will charge to 100% in ac and during trips i will charge in DC as much required to cover the next destination or next AC/DC.
Hi @Mebz4.. thanks for you knowledge .My priority is reliability and I don't want to be  hassled with  critical issues and get deserted in middle of road and don't want to spend time on sc ( i am fine with software glitches as long as car keeps running).  Given that could you please suggest which one should I go for  H ev or X ev ?
"Since the old tata cars used old BMS systems which were 1st generation ev products they needed to be charged regularly from 20 % to 100 % for them to work without any issues , people using only 50 % of the battery and charjing up to 100 % used to face cell inbalancing issues and hence a D2N issue ...at the same time people using the car more than 60 to 100 kms daily dint face much issues , like my nexon ev max which i used in tourist for 1 year and 1.8 lac kms only DC fast charged under 1 c charge rate never gave me any Battery issues"
5) you can also charge it once in 3 months if your use is very very low just make sure to keep the car parked at 60 %
4) you can also charge the car daily if it's comfortable just reach home and plug it in there's no problem
3) you can charge any how you please just make sure not to keep the car below 30 % for more.than 12 hours
2) you don't land up discharging below 20 % regularly which helps the life of Lifepo4 cells as they hate going below 20 % regularly
1) The advantage of buying a large battery pack has many advantages for the user as well as the car
Very good question am glad you asked this
As you have a great experience in charging I'm asking a basic question - does harrier ev have to be charged frequently - I mean once in a week. Is it ok to charge once in 15 days? Is ev is only for heavy users or normal users can also buy it?
You always have to value convenience and value for money and see what is more important for you
It's very good value for money like most tata products are
Yes if you can check and let us know and the main thing is how to rectify that issue. So the solution will be helpful. As mostly all decided already to buy harrier ev
But In the one day I had the car there was definitely charging issues
Luckily they have covered the wheel arches but am yet to find where they have placed the lock pin actuator system and the emergency release once I study the system I will understand if they could be any potential problems
"All the differences apart, you‚Äôve got a really nice place out there"
Anyways tata sending their vehicle to me in a few days as a long termer will come to know everything once its with me for a week
Can you give a few tips to avoid these kinds of issues in Harrier ev. Is this caused due to a bad road or anything else?
"Yes, they‚Äôve opened in gurugram as well. They‚Äôre getting good reviews as well"
"Old dealers are opposing it , there are 2 opened in Delhi it seems"
Oh okay..! I heard tata setting up a separate ev service centre's so hope it will be better in coming days
"Yes they are trying to improve that is true , but unfortunately due to large volume sales their workshops and after sales services like towing are over booked and stressed so expect long wait times and recurring problems with things fixed"
Cool..! So tata as a product is good but here and there we see some issues and which is also rectified nowadays as tata improving its service right?
Will you choose a harrier ev as your primary vehicle?
"@Mebz4 a genuine question.
If you had to choose between harrier ev and XeV9e. Which one would you choose?"
"Guys,
I spoke to Meherab just now. He is a genuine guy with good knowledge on EVs.

Things I learned from him
1. Tata is not as reliable as other high budget EVs are.
2. Service may be delayed and biased to known individuals.

Summary:
If you are ready to adjust small bits and have good relations with TATA service, you can go ahead with Harrier EV.


But if you are a person who feels that on spending 30 lakh, you will have a hassle free experience, you should think again.

Please don't corner him and let's listen what he has to say without any bias and add on our knowledge on EVs."
Some cheap charging stations like the ones on petrol pumps has these issues
üòÇ
There must be a problem with your charging station . Get it checked by a professional
"Yes, even with open eyes you can‚Äôt differentiate between a Nexon and harrier"
If you are able to share harrier related issues and problems from your community that‚Äôs will be very helpful.
Does tata curvv has these issues?
In India which city has good roads and infrastructure?
""
Too late for that mate
we would like to understand harrier EV problems if there is any please share .
can you please share a video where harrier EV is stuck ?
"I don‚Äôt think you are experienced enough to comment on other vehicles.
You can just share your experience with ev which clearly was not good"
I think you‚Äôve faced a lot of issues with your tata ev and you want to spread the same hate everywhere
I don‚Äôt see any logic in your statements
Share here also

Not a 30L car
"This is nexon, not harrier"
"This is not an answer I was expecting.

If u got so much knowledge then help people who message you . Dont fight here
üíØ right
I also got to learn Today from you that lowering a person's IQ on the fly to suit ones purpose is possible interesting facts
"Threaten?
I think simple words are too much to understand even for you as a claimed group guru

As I said earlier, stop messaging on group 
Regarding me messaging to you personally, I would rather not lower my IQ to get to that level

If you are too alone and wants everyone to call you, suggest there are multiple websites online for you to get your time pass done"
Let's do it over call ü§ô
"I suggest all self claimed group gurus to keep their thoughts to themselves 

We never said you are a group guru, you can call yourself anything you want 
Regarding changes being difficult to me, better to keep your thoughts to yourself instead of being preacher about somebody's else life thoughts

I believe you are mature enough to understand that"
"Look at this group today, I would be more interested in what people are facing, their issues etc 

Not everyone's messages of why what they are saying is correct logic
As I said, logic and decision is best kept at potential buyers

You made your points. Now stop the messages 
If it is a chat between two or three people, I suggest to message on personal chats"
But I also travel outskirts and villages
Can you suggest any premium ev that is reliable
Now?
What has affected you so much now ?
"4x4 vehicles defination to type here is too much effort , but all I can say is that the harrier ev is a AWD vehicle which is different from 4x4 and AWD is best suited for MILD to low Offroading also known as a softroader which actually offers big powerful cars more traction on highways and helps putting down all that power and torque evenly on the road and slippery wet conditions"
"Can we stop this thing now?
All other members have listened to everyone's point now 
We got everyone's logic

Now let's keep the choices to make with the actual owners"
[Abhishek](tg://user?id=6929388459) pls call up Tata motors customer care asap raise a complaint against the dealership
Thanks Mebz for all the insights.
"Wonderful , and where is the safety release incase there is an emergency"
Under the charging port
""
Earlier Nexon and Tiago had an exposed area under the charging gun. In Harrier they have fully covered it
what do you mean by it
Guys check the area under the charging port of the Harrier if they have fully covered it or not?
got the issue thanks
so this is monsoon specific issue? or round the year ?
or legacy infra used
is it because of moisture?
Is this observed in Tata only?
whats the specific reason why its get stuck
"So should we not go for EV?

Or is there any other option?

I am genuinely asking"
https://youtube.com/shorts/QkhgqnO_x54?si=TbhGoj37mrCPgYNK

Yes suspension is quite good and all those features are gimmicry which we will never use
Today i had a test drive in Coimbatore but auto parking / park assist and many more features not worked. When i ask showroom engineer says needs to be software updated . but overall performance is good and i have also drive in some off road condition using sand mode. It works well. I used to drive in my scorpio in the same road but body rolling is less when compared with scorpio.

Exactly
For an SUV which was driven in rain with varying speed the range he got was fine. 5.33km/kWh if driven with a little more careful he could easily extract 6km/kwh or 450km
Also he should have not crossed 90kph and regen should have been 0
Almost his entire journey was in city mode. I think he forgot that the car has an eco mode itself

"163 cm is laden ground clearance 
When fully loaded to max load 

Like fortuners ground clearance is 225 mm but laden ground clearance is 185 mm"
You can enable or disable this function
How about tail gate pollution? Will that be ok for any class?
https://www.team-bhp.com/news/arai-updates-ground-clearance-measurement-standards
"Previously, the ground clearance was measured in the unladen state. The suspension tends to compress in the laden state due to the extra added weight. As a result, the new rule has reduced the officially mentioned ground clearance of many vehicles. For example, the new Toyota Fortuner's official laden ground clearance is 184 mm. However, as per the older rule, the unladen rating is 225 mm."
"No the lowest point will not hit, it's for measurement only"
So before hitting footstep that lowest point will hit the ground; correct me if I‚Äôm missing something
"163mm is not the actual GC, it's around 205. 163mm is calculated at the lowest point as shown in picture."
163 mm isn‚Äôt too low for offroad?
On large speed breakers the footstep supports will hit first
"Talked to dealership and service team
As per team, foot rest is placed lower vs Battery
So in any case, battery will not touch, it will be footrest if you go over very big obstacles"
Those are big 19 inch wheels look at where the body is placed relatively. Easily 200mm ground clearance is there.

Fluctuates with repo
"Keep the charge 60-70 %. Disconnect the auxiliary battery and leave it.
Before starting the car after coming back, reconnect the auxiliary battery, slow charge the car to 100% and also check the coolant before driving.
Here again you need to talk to your sc or make arrangements for the 6 month service. Or it may void warranty."
As per my understanding - If you are going to leave the vehicle idle for a long time keep soc at 40 to 50% and also check if there is some shutdown option like ev scooters so you can shutdown the vehicle during that time
Flat or will fluctuate with repo rate ?
"I have a query.


If I charge my car upto 80% and keep it for a year (going out of country). Will that affect the battery in any way?"
"A service camp was held a few weeks ago in our residential complex. One of our cars hadn‚Äôt been serviced for over 8 months, as it had only been driven around 1,000 km during that time it‚Äôs our spare car.

Since the camp was taking place in our complex, I decided to get this spare car checked. To my surprise, I learned that it‚Äôs important to have regular service visits. The coolant had completely dried up, even though there was no leak. The technician explained that this is normal for cars, which is why they recommend servicing every 6 months.

It‚Äôs Hyundai Verna"
so will directly take there if it does not voids warranty
"yes thats why, the tyre showroom is just a km away from tata showroom"
No relation between tyres and warranty as discussed with dealer
"If you replace same day, it will fetch you better value for the original tyres."
i am okay with range hit due to tyres and even NVH i am okay.
so was planning to get them replaced with normal  A/T tyres (Not hardcore) the day i get my car
It's up to you. Not mandatory to use any specific tyres. Type of tyre may slightly affect your range.
"because i take my car to my village sometimes, and highway terrain tyres get stuck easily there, so i think these EV tyres will definiteluy wont handle sand better than highway terrains"
"one thing, is it mandatory for EV warranty to only use foam tyres speciic for EV's or we can use normal tyres?"
That's great
Service is very fast unlike in ice cars. 15k service also takes just few hours if there is no other work .
I mean days*
Yes got it and what will be the average they will take to service
Yes. You have to do both 6 month and I year service irrespective of low kms. This is required for warranty whether it is life time or 8 years in other cars.
"Once in 6 months is always good for any car ICE or EV doesn‚Äôt matter 

Lubes gets dried 

If you give time to time car components will last for very long period"
If the service is done on same day then it's fine if it takes a week for each service then something to worry
"atleast thats what i think, others can chip in if thats normal"
thats not nice from tata to be honest
6 months and 1 year
we have to get both services done
yes even we dont drive 5k in a year
So even if we didn't drive 15kms atleast once in a year we must do the major service right?
Minor service
""
"so service wise i would say EV's are same as ICE cars  , tata should have offered once a year service for EV's atleast"
and 3k for the 7.5kms service right?
Yep
4K
this is for major service right?
""
to be honest thats not good from tata.
"okay thanks, also tata has included monthly service along with kms wise, so in any case one has to get two services done in a year, weather they drive 15k or not . or even if they drive 7.5k , two services are mandatory, considering they will bring this issue in battery warranty"
Let me say actual
Been a long time I told average
Let me open and see
and how much for the 15k km's service?
For harrier also more or less it will be the same SA told me yesterday it may not be more than 5k even I called service centre advisor who takes care of Nexon he also told it‚Äôs more or less the same price of Nexon they don‚Äôt have an extra cost is what he told me all EV service price are very similar is what he told expect the components cost which might change for car to car
My average cost for Nexon is around 3k for service
"Yep, Nexon"
"Yes. All tata evs are serviced like this. 7.5 is just a check up ensuring that there is enough coolant etc is there. Cost is negligible. 
 At 15 k is major service and they change transaxial (gear oil) oil and ac filter etc. Which cost few thousands."

"What the charges for rvery 7500 km
General checkup?"
"Yes...my friend have punch & nexon...


For harrier battery unlimited km warranty ..this is also one condition..."
Any class 10 sd card with 10 yr warranty is enough...
Any tata ev user (punch or nexon) do you service in these intervals?
Yes...7.5k is general checkup and 15k is actual service....it is in all tata evs..idk about others
Ya might be i was testing that too in signal
Harrier was pulling 15.8kw speed at 97% (jio BP gun)
You tried switching on Auto Hold ??
"Not recommended, one can invite warranty issues with matting, please try 7D mats"
I need to check that mostly while running it won't open i think. Also while I'm pressing on the horn accidentally my fingers touch some of the dashboard controls and Adas controls.
"No need to worry about HV error in new tata cars. They have a self healing technology and even if a hv error pop up, all you need is to just restart the car to solve it."
"Please avoid floor Lamination as it is not advisable at all in an EV.
Over time, micro-cracks can develop in the floor lamination. These cracks can trap moisture and water between the lamination layer and the metal floor. This trapped moisture leads to rusting and corrosion.

In the rare event of a thermal runaway (battery fire), emergency response may require flooding the underbody with large amounts of water to cool the battery pack.A laminated floor can block or slow down water entry, hindering cooling efforts and increasing risk during such critical situations."
That‚Äôs why it opens only after holding it for few seconds
"It‚Äôs simple what happens in running car if somebody (kids üë∂) presses the break or opens the door in other cars same thing will happen üòÖ

And only an fool makes the over active kid to sit in front side"

"At the same time who knows what better teck will come this to happen

At the point Tesla is know for EVs even it doesn‚Äôt allow user to disengage"
"Nope this is not ICE car which gets engaged mechanics gears, EVs are designed to be like this"
"That‚Äôs exactly how it‚Äôs designed. If users want to control everything, then why would they need computers? üòÖ Anyway, you‚Äôll see that when it‚Äôs used more widely, it‚Äôll engage smoothly without drawing too much power. The power reduced in the rear wheel is balanced out this way, giving the user a much more comfortable and stable drive"
Even tata is showing only 10-20 km diff
"If you press the pedal hard, it gets activated... It's also activated during adaptive cruise control... These things can be tweaked with a simple update.... especially adaptive cruise control. 

That's the beauty of buying an evolving vehicle.... it can be improved and fine-tuned through a simple OTA update."
"I hope in the future , a software update come so that front motor can be switched off if we want.. can only be activated when esp and boost mode and difficult terrain modes get activated"
"The rear motor is PMSM which is very efficient. The QWD has an induction motor in the front which not as efficient, also in certain situations it automatically gets engaged. The user doesn't have any control on that which effects the range more than the 100 odd weight difference"
üéâ
Ya
Yes ...there will be diff in tuning but hardware is same...we have to wait for reviews of rwd
Both get similar setups at the front and rear. Only difference is that the awd has more refined tuning for off road
"If you're choosing RWD just because you think it will give you 50‚Äì60 km more range than AWD, I would suggest to wait. If money is not an issue, then go for AWD."
AWD is built with off roading features so there must be some difference in RWD which is on road driving logically Right?
it is only 100 kg lighter...so i dont thing there will be much difference
Range is one factor and what about suspension whether rear wheel drive vehicle suspension will have a difference when compared to AWD. Any thoughts
""
There might be hardly 10-20 km range diff between rwd and QWD...
400 -450 is sweet spot.
"I think this is very much in line with my yesterday‚Äòs driving experience as well 

Overall it‚Äôs very decent I am happy with range and power 

My current Nexon EV 30kW give me aprox 220 on highway out of this itself I made decent trips of 400 to 700kms and charge infra is getting better day by day so anything above 400 is more than enough if we get more than that‚Äôs it‚Äôs a bonus üòÄ"
"https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxGS_3TUyqBFVhF1Urttfw7r2SLaS2vr1O?si=l0cBnKqGmF2iSzRm



He explained all the adas features"
Thanks man
"This is also not known by many so called influencers 

They think ADAS, Lane Assist and Cruise Control is all the same üòÇ"
Yes
üëç
Via Tata head of sales India
Brilliant working buddy üëç
"Is it possible to turn off lane keep assist while ADAS is still on?

And Cruise control is OFF"
@KaNaK108 ?
Very well explained.. it is really helpful..üëç
Check out this one...i averaged the range tests of approx 10 yotuber..with 70-90 you will can get 500+ in AWD..
80-90 is the sweet spot
Nope..
"Exactly....in real-world... there will be a lot of city driving too.... Except for occasional long highway trips, you won't usually be driving at 120‚Äì140 km/h.

Once you get familiar with your car....like knowing that driving above 120 km/h gives you a certain range... 

and driving at 80‚Äì90 km/h gives you more....

you will already have peace of mind."
Have you driven the RWD?
True
I thinK we should rely more on actual range than AEC.
"I think I will not be surprised to see 450 / 500+ as a common mark in many users as hardly we use 120 plus for Safty reasons 

but in test cars obviously we can‚Äôt expect that"
Absolutely that‚Äôs what even I felt
"I thinks you can get 400 to 500 easily my reason to say it‚Äôs single motor and lesser weight so you may not get tempted to use mega power like what QWD delivers u have driven RWD variant in city for about 30km about Week back power is  like zameen aasman difference 

You can definitely fell the power of induction motor kicking in after you cross 100km it‚Äôs like how turbo opens in ICE cars when powered with turbo"
Any members used this ?
Its part of adas level 2.
"Car gave range of 200km in 40%...5 km in 1% with rough use...approx 500 km with daily use is easy..

Coz in last 20% it will easily give 120 + considering..speed limit after 10% and again 5%...i have seen 50-60 km in last  5%"
RWD is approx 200 kg less in weight than AWD variants
At 22 lak it's an excellent value for money car for people who travel in city and to office. For that occasional highway trip it can easily do a 600km one way with a charging stop. The 75kw will give an additional 60km range but even that will have to be charged on that highway trip but time taken for the charging stop will be less.

"Lane keep assist actually.

It's different than ADAS"
Mahindra's Agent üòÇ
These ‚úåÔ∏èyoutubes‚úåÔ∏è were saying ..steering is stiff ...steering is stiff ..it was because of ADAS
"@Tataev shipped a whopping 7124 units of EVs in July 2025 with 40% growth üíπ MOM+YOY,
 Previous high was Jan 2024 with 6979 units during Punch EV launch üî•"
"Around 360km if we take consumption at 180wh/km, if driven conservatively not exceeding 85 kph 400km at 160wh/km"
"To know minute details like:
1. Lane keep assit will harden steering.
2. Seat adjustment for tall people is not just about too and fro but much more.


Many influencers don't know these details and simply say steering is hard or seat can't accommodate tall people"
You can ping me sep we can discuss
65 kWh Is 200 kg less in weight as well so in my opinion it should give you 350 - 400 km
Range wise
How much can we expect from 65 kwh battery back with normal driving
"These were well laid observations and kudus to you for doing it passionately! 

It helps the community üëç"
no I am just trying to understand nothing else since @CredR_Siva has added @Mebz4 in this group but we have not heard from him so just asked.
He too doesn‚Äôt know
"The cruise control is also very good. It recognizes road signs, adjusts speed limits automatically, and adapts to the distance of other cars in front (adaptive cruise control)"
@KaNaK108 how did you made a deal of making td for 200km
+2
+1
"**Comfort, Climate & Sound System**
We spent about **15 minutes parked**, AC running, watching videos, and playing music. Even with the **sunroof glass closed** but **shade open**, the cabin stayed cool. Temperature outside was 30¬∞C, and we set the cabin to 21¬∞C.
My dad initially didn‚Äôt feel cooling in the back seat but once I turned **SYNC ON** (dual-zone climate control), it worked perfectly.
And the **audio system?** Absolutely **out of this world.** If you don‚Äôt have a home theatre, you might just start spending your evenings in your car.

**Final Thoughts**
I haven‚Äôt even tested **off-road modes** like Mud/Ruts, Rock Crawl, Sand, or Snow/Grass. My entire experience was on normal roads and in standard drive conditions. And even without that, **this car has blown me away.**

The value it delivers is unreal. I know comparing an ICE with an EV isn‚Äôt apples-to-apples but I **genuinely** feel this car offers a **driving and comfort experience on par with something like the Land Rover Defender P400, which costs over ‚Çπ1.25 crore.** No exaggeration.
For its price, for what it offers, for how it makes you __feel behind the wheel__ **it is super, super, super value for money.**

**Conclusion:**
I walked in curious and few questions. I walked out converted. The **Tata Harrier EV** has won my heart.
And no, again I‚Äôm not being paid to say this."
"**A Family Perspective**
There were **three of us** in the car: me, my father, and the sales associate.
My father drove for about **20 km** and when we stopped, he looked at me and said just one word: **‚ÄúWow.‚Äù** Then he added with a smile, __""What‚Äôs stopping you from giving the final payment? Why the delay?""__
He found both the **front and rear seats very comfortable.** The only minor feedback he gave was a slight jump in the rear seat over humps (which wasn‚Äôt felt in the front). Even that was negligible and only in comparison to the front seats.

**ADAS A Lifesaver (Literally)**
The **ADAS system** worked brilliantly. It saved us **twice today**:
**1. Highway at 155 km/h**: A truck suddenly swerved into our lane. The Harrier EV **slammed the brakes hard and fast.** All of us including the sales associate in the back were wearing seatbelts, and I __highly__ recommend always doing so. My dad gave me a little ‚Äúpooja‚Äù (if you know, you know) and immediately asked me to stick to 100 km after that üòÖ2. 
**City at 20 km/h**: An auto-rickshaw suddenly braked in front of us. ADAS intervened again but this time the braking was **smooth and gentle**, likely due to the low speed. I was shocked the **ADAS reacted faster than me**!3. 
All of this on **default ADAS settings** I didn‚Äôt tweak anything.

**Charging & Range Observations**
‚Ä¢ Start Battery: **66%**‚Ä¢ 
End Battery: **26%**‚Ä¢ 
Odometer: From **933 km ‚Üí 1134 km**‚Ä¢ 
Distance Driven: **201 km**‚Ä¢ 
Energy Consumption (Dashboard): **200 Wh/km**‚Ä¢ 
Extrapolated Range: **~375 km** (This may be lower due to Sport/Boost mode use and not charging to 100%)‚Ä¢ 
In my estimate:
**‚Ä¢ 400+ km in spirited driving**‚Ä¢ 
**450+ km in **relaxed, efficient driving"
"**First Impressions & Tech Surprises**
The Harrier EV isn‚Äôt just a tech savvy car  it‚Äôs **Hi-Tech**, and truly packed with features. Honestly, you need to spend a **couple of hours just to understand and appreciate** what this machine offers. It's not just smart; it's **intelligently intuitive and true engineering leap by TATA.**

Initially, on the highway, I felt the steering was a bit stiff. Later, I realized it was due to **Lane Keep Assist** being ON. This system gently nudges you to stay within lanes, which might feel tight if you're trying to drive aggressively. Once I adjusted the settings  keeping only visual and audio lane alerts active the steering became smooth like butter.

**Performance ‚Äì A Beast in SUVs not just EVs**

The Harrier EV is very powerful. **I touched a top speed of 155 km/h** (I didn‚Äôt go beyond due to safety). What shocked me was that I hit **145 km/h even in Eco mode** and it didn‚Äôt feel like the car was trying too hard.

On curves at over 110 km/h, the car was planted and confident **no drama, no sway, just smooth control.** Even village roads posed no challenge the suspension and ride quality handled it effortlessly."
""
"**My Heartfelt Experience with the Tata Harrier EV ‚Äì A Drive That Made Me a True Fan**

This is going to be a long message, straight from my heart and personal experience. Let me start by saying clearly: **I am not a promoter, influencer, or associated with Tata in any way.** I walked into this test drive with curiosity, and I walked out a genuine fanboy of the __Tata Harrier EV.__

**The Drive: 201 km of Discovery**
Today, I drove a total of **201 km** in the Harrier EV. Here's a breakdown:
**‚Ä¢ ~50 km in peak city traffic**
**‚Ä¢ ~150 km on highways**
I tested every mode available:
**‚Ä¢ City**
**‚Ä¢ Eco**
**‚Ä¢ Sport**
**‚Ä¢ Sport+ Boost**

I spent an average of **30 km in each mode**, except for City mode, where I drove nearly **100 km**.
I also experimented with **regen levels** (0, 1, 2, and 3) across these modes. Due to all this mode switching, my personal photos and range observations may not reflect typical consumption they‚Äôre more for reference than final conclusions.

**Model Driven**: __Harrier EV QWD Empowered 75__"

who is Mebz ? Let me ask simple question?

Bro just text can you pls share video
"Probably not. It was only for 10K cars , if I buy Nexon now they are giving 1.5 L on invoice. But not sure about Harrier as it will be delivered in Sep-25"
As all positive feedback has been given by influencers already
"You won‚Äôt get that, leave"
Just Saying : why do u guys need feedback when u guys have decided u wanna go further with HEV hehe
"Never mind, it‚Äôs better here, moreover p a will post ads and entertain us once in a while"

"Let them be a fanboy of anyone Vivek, but to stay in this grp when ur not buying or not even considering harrier ev as ur choice. I was happy when i saw 9e but harrier killed it. So yeah take the best which is for u. Who ever supports mahindra can join thr grp and have fun üòä"
Can you pls share a video ?
"Guys, I guess we are not here to get influenced or make any decision. 

I am here as I have made my decision and want to explore this journey with like minded fellas and get knowledge. 

Also those who are genuine buyers for Harrier don't care about joining any Mahindra EV group and tell them how good Harrier is over other cars because I simply don't care about what I don't like. However one should think and explore about what we like."
"I don't think these were Siva's observations 
He just forwarded what some other guy pointed out to him
And same is what people are saying"
Kitne Tejaswi log hein hahahahahhahah
"Doodh ka doodh
Paani ka paani

"Expect suspension, all other things we can judge for ourself at the showroom as per our needs..... We don't need any expert for it.... With regards to suspension YT videos tell a completely different story stating that it's better then BE6 and XEV 9E....."
"Attaching Team BHP review on ride, clearly mentioning Harrier EV ride is better than XEV 9E with semi active suspension 

Also read how he says car handles well and remains planted"
"@J18068101 sir my mom is like 58 yrs old and has knee pains, I asked her feedback about ingress and egress after the TD. She replied it‚Äôs easy and comfortable. I always value real time feedback"
"Come on buddy, it's everywhere these days. I booked 9e pack 2, earlier and cancelled and reb√≥oked harrier ev. Yesterday i saw a review of 9e pack 2. I was thanking good that I made a right choice in booking harrier ev. So yeah. We made right decision. Let ppl say wat they wanna say"
"Can‚Äôt believe he took our call today 

OMG"
"He‚Äôs a Mahindra guy, just ignore"
That‚Äôs what
"My wife is 5'3"" , I am 5'10"", my father & brother is 6'2""
Took the test drive of XEV 9E & Harrier EV on same road, driven back to back for 100 kms
My and family observations were quite opposite to this guy

Hell all the people who have done the test drive, have just the opposite to this great reviewer 

Because of side step, Harrier EV is the easiest to get in and out
BE 6 is most pathetic, everyone hit their head while getting in and out

Ergonomic wise : Harrier EV > XEV 9E 

despite the wheelbase and length advantages of XEV 9E, rear seat space is comparable 
XEV 9E has just slightly better knee room ( ~ 0.5 - 1"" )
But the biggest difference is Rear Headroom 
My head was just about brushing against roof in XEV 9E 
No such problem in Harrier EV 
Both my brother & father being taller, they had no headroom in XEV 9E 
If you recline the rear seats, due to coupe shape the headroom becomes even worse

So knee room : XEV 9E > Harrier EV 
Headroom: Harrier EV >> XEV 9E 

Now coming to suspension part, heck even all reviewers are praising this car
Take Team BHP for example, they spent last 3 days driving XEV 9E before coming to Harrier EV media drive
Mahindra invited Team BHP, booked their flight and stays and arranged everything for them to experience XEV 9E, as Mahindra knew Harrier EV media drive is coming in next days
And Team BHP observation was : Harrier EV has better suspension and ride quality than XEV 9E with semi active suspension 

During my test drive, drove both XEV 9E & Harrier EV on very bad roads 
My parents have back pain problem, guess which car they liked in ride comfort? Harrier EV 

And coming to the body roll part, took the same turn at 90kmph on highway in both cars, Both the vehicles are exactly same in terms of roll

So people kindly check for yourself before believing on someone's else words

There are lot of Cancellation on Mahindra Showroom for EVs, and a lot of negative stories are being created around Harrier EV 

Remember in this market, currently there is no better value for money product 

The same situation happened when Windsor EV was launched, everyone started pointed out rubbish things about car because every OEM was threatened for their product 

And Getting this guy some water, Harrier doors are narrow & opening is small? Seriously?
This point itself should have been red flag considering everyone has seen the car and checked the ingress egress"

"I don't fully agree to sivas friends review/comments. Yes it's not super great suspension but it's not that bad. Be 6e and xev 9e two radarss in the high end have intelligent suspension based on the radar which was superb, I experienced it during the td. But it's only in the pack 3 which is 36L on road in Bangalore. Harrier is not that bad in suspension, its decent enough. Body roll over is thr considering the weight of the car and battery pack placed under, its bound to happen. Again not that bad. Ingree and engress is pretty decent I agree not 90 degree door opening like mahindra twins. Again that ok for sure. Leg room is perfect I experienced it too. Two adult and child comfortablly sit three heavy weight adults it's a bit tough I agree. Older ppl for sure will have some level of difficulty especially in any suv. Harrier ice still has the same body, I did not see so much complains on ingress and egress. Don't know why this talk is coming for harrier ev alone."

[01/08, 4:59‚ÄØpm] mebz: It's a mixed bag but mostly our roads with such potholes make the harrier ev very un comfortable and transmits the body shocks into the cabin on these certain potholes and road conditions and is not consistent

I heard the same exact thing during my TD
"Yes, Happened to meet an R&D engineer during my test drive.

He told me the same thing that the R&D team is spread across multiple cities to see that everything if working properly 

As per him, few test drive cars are pre production cars which were used in Quad days and Media drive, hence they don't have the latest software 

All the customer delivery cars are having latest software so customers are not facing any issue

It is just test drive cars, in that also they are flushing the latest software so that dealership can show all features"

I found some PDI for  I‚Äôll be sharing it
And nexon 45 which type of cell use cylindrical or prismatic
ok but it‚Äôs octillion only
Sale volume of curvv is also less compare to nexon
No harrier have cylindrical cells..curvv have prismatic
Shall we also join currv.ev group on telegram and check there ?
have we seen any issues with Tata Curvv EV it has been in market for more than 10 months now ? pls share if any since harrier is sharing its battery pack and bms?
Yes..the issue is these engineers are not well trained..because tech is updating rapidly...and upgrading workforce is a task...
Even showrooms will get seperated soon
But only tata have dedicated ev company...and maybe they will separate ev service centers.
But ultimate goal is same
They can also call technician as an engineer..
Possible case
I think tata has done this deliberately..to avoid accidental touch...
But this info is genuine. Challenge me if you can

Yes
"We should make a new group, the admin hasn‚Äôt been online for a month."
This was during my 2nd test drive
"One thing the Test Drive guy told me is that the engineers from Tata motors are spread across multiple cities to address any of the issues related harrier ev if they find any. The ultimate goal of TATA is to deliver a zero defect product. Relax, Tata is considering it very prestigious."
"The only issue I noticed during test drive is summon mode, other than that everything is good."
"Chill guys, he just forwarded the text he received."

Tata Harrier EV Waiting Period Up To 30 Weeks - Massive Demand https://share.google/J687VvGjbpZ9rsOvx
"This 70% is in reference to the eligibility for replacement during the warranty period.  It comes with 100% and this is assured by tata. You have to believe them, no other option."
Never mind
Apologies
Ok
"No no, may be you have mistaken me for someone else"
Sir you said earlier you have Nexon EV ?
Raipur
Location?
If we ask them politely and I don‚Äôt think it will be a tough task ?
"Pls someone make a checklist for EV Pre Inspection Delivery, that would help lot of us who are first time EV buyers like me"
But how do we do that ?
I was reading their warranty and it is clearly mentioned that they make sure 70% of SOH always. So after delivery if we get shortage of range they might not consider even battery SOH is let‚Äôs say 85% or 90%
Yes - and hence we need to do our own validation
correct but we can‚Äôt believe SA for obvious reasons what if they could deliver with SOH 95% or 90% possible right ?
SA said it will be 100%
"That's what I said, they may have improved things now. Like now they have very clear policy on battery claims. Previously there were reported rejections and disputed were happening."
guys one doubt when taking delivery are you guys ensuring the SOH of battery is 100% or it is just assumed?
"I have checked at 
KHT and Prerena - leading Tata dealers for bangalore and the feedback is possitive."
So preference garage scenario is now ruled out !
What they are promoting is every single authorised dealer who has a GST has been empaneled in there data base for claim settlement .
"There were many complaints about their high-value claim settlements. The main issue was that they insist on repairs at their preferred garages instead of authorized company workshops. One such insistence was reportedly the cause of the infamous Nexon EV fire in Pune.
 May be they have improved now. There are very happy customers also."
Never heard or experienced
Settlement ratio of 99.91%
IRDA data has this to say
"Saw in other group regard to 
ACKO negative feedback in terms of claim rejection! 

Has any member experienced ACKO Before ? 

For me it will be first time"

Go for solar asap
Better to go to 15kw
"We already have 2 for house , so applied 1 separately for car"
I have 4 acs 3 geysers tv fridge washing machine so dont want to take risk
Sub meter right?
Are planning to setup 120kw dc at home üòÖ
It‚Äôs costing around 7k
Mine is 3phase 10kw want to inv it to 15kw
Ok üëç
Will connect with u
""
So I took one meter only for ev car charging
"Ours is an independent house , so we can apply 4 metres"
Increase the load at TGSPDCL app
"No need , you can do from the app"
Do we need a new meter if we increase load?
I already have 3 phase and 4 KW now and need to increase to 8 KW
I paid 14k for new meter connection for 10kw meter 3 phase in Hyderabad
From 5 kw you need 3 phase connection. You can request online in most discoms.
1st visit ur EB.. talk sweetly.. they will help u.. then u have to apply online and make payment online.. then inform EB.. he will start process of installation.
Replacing with 3phase
"Pls share the process in Maharashtra, I also need to do"
Are you just increasing load or replacing 1-phase to 3 phase connection?
Do we have to increase the sanction load online or need to visit EB
I'm in the process
Here in Maharashtra it can be done in max 20-25k
"It can be removed but after that you have to put it in house , can't put in car"
Agree üëç
Need to put few visits to BESCOM office and still bribe them and pay the official pricing as well.
"Yes you can 

But you have pay extra"
Also can we just increase our current home meter from 3kw to 8 and facilitate the same meter for our ev charging. Instead of a separate meter?
Then ok. I was thinking why BESCOM was asking so much
"Wait till Bescomm nos !! 
These are from private Solar players"
Wait untill? Till your apartment/society installs public charger?
"Have rejected this offer ! 

Will wait for installation ACFC later"
All inclusive
"This is BESCOMs official pricing? What abt bribing etc, Or this includes that?"

The ICE variants initial launch dates are kept 2 years apart
True
"I don‚Äôt think safari might get launched anytime soon as they might see sales decline on harrier ev, considering harrier ev as their flagship product and yeah harrier ev will definitely have a negative impact on nexon ev sales and currv ev sales"
Tata safari EV will probably launch next year at same time as harrier as its new segment.
"We are hopeful 

Safari EV has a launch in India"
"But God knows how long you will have to wait.

I am not able to wait 2 months for Harrier lolz"

I checked ICE prices. They are having narrow price gaps.
Pls correct me if
"5K means

Why u say 5 Lcs ?

No boss. I think it will be in same package as Harrier. Don't expect much changes

Maharashtra Government guidelines for EV charger in societies
PrathamMalik Banjara hills
"As per the Maharashtra government's policies and recent court rulings, there are clear directives requiring housing societies to allow and facilitate personal EV charging facilities.
Here's a breakdown of the key points:
 * Bombay High Court Ruling: The Bombay High Court has explicitly directed the Maharashtra government to finalize rules and ordered housing societies to facilitate the installation of EV charging stations. The court emphasized that societies cannot deny residents the right to install charging points, provided safety conditions are met.
 * Maharashtra EV Policy 2025: The latest Maharashtra Electric Vehicle Policy (effective from April 1, 2025, to March 31, 2030) includes significant provisions for EV charging in residential buildings:
   * New residential buildings: Must ensure 100% EV charging-ready parking and install at least one community charging station.
   * Existing housing societies: Are encouraged to implement shared EV charging spaces, with 50% member approval required for this.
   * The policy also provides for concessional electricity tariffs for EV charging and encourages a digital single-window portal for approvals.
 * NOC Requirement: A circular issued by the Co-operative Commissioner and Registrar, Maharashtra State, mandates that housing societies must issue a ""No Objection Certificate"" (NOC) within seven days of receiving an application, provided the resident adheres to the safety guidelines prescribed by the Chief Electrical Inspector.
 * Safety Guidelines: There are specific safety advisories and standard operating procedures for EV charging stations (EVCS) in multi-storey buildings across Maharashtra. These cover aspects like:
   * Installation height (at least 800mm above flood level)
   * Child-proof designs
   * Protection from water ingress and mechanical damage
   * Proximity to parking spaces (within 5 meters)
   * Fire safety requirements and equipment.
 * Residents' Right: The overarching theme from various directives and rulings is the reinforcement of residents' rights to install EV chargers in their designated parking spaces. Distribution licensees are also mandated to ensure electricity supply, either through the existing meter or a separate sub-meter.
In essence, housing societies in Maharashtra are increasingly required to accommodate EV charging, both for individual residents and through common facilities, to support the state's electric mobility mission."
Good news for people in Maharashtra

In case of emergencies i will use it
Can you pls drop the location
"By any chance will be you able take owner number of that fuel station, we also have IOC fuel station at Kolar I need to check with them about installation of EV charger and is it worth doing it in fuel station"

"It‚Äôs not automated 

It was a response on my email"
Is this an automated mail from them once we opt for their insurance or you requested a mail from them for battery related cover?
Reposting
Rotate this anti-clock wise
"in highways you will generally charge 50% max for example upto 80%, so whenever you battery reaches 20-30% you will decide to top up. you can accordingly plan your stops and charging."
Same
120 kw charger in my area..
Call
Didn‚Äôt understand ?
Did you rotate?
Still touching the knee
Yes full down and back
"Guys even I had same issue but the knob which goes front and back should be rotated in anti clock wise and the seat will go further down and back.

Many sales guys don't know this.

I guess August deliveries will be ST edition
"I‚Äôm a 6‚Äô2 inch guy , even my knee was touching the dashboard"

Dealer's mind and real voice will be Dude u want the car or not? üòâ I will give to that customer tell me.
"Just ask them for PDI
And take 3rd party guy as your friend"
"Which varient? I believe white and grey are for lower varient. 

Oxide , blue are addition for top models"
Most of the dealers are not allowing it.
"Did anyone ask for 3rd party PDI to dealer?

My dealer has denied"
"Usually after PDI and before invoicing. These will be required to make your loan disbursement by  bank.

 Also you need to take insurance to send it for rto registration."
Yes once your 100% payment is done to dealer
When can we get this? Post vehicle allotment?
Thanks sir
Only chasis no and Engine no is required for insurance.  They will update the vehicle no later.

Regarding the handling part in one podcast they mentioned that this vehicle is fully designed from an off-roading perspective. That is why on-road handing is average but I doubt whether that is QWD alone or for other variant RWD too. As RWD is designed for on-road so need to check whether handling is better in that.
"Specific Issues:
Software: Infotainment and driver display software can be buggy, with flickering screens and warning lights. 
Summon Mode: The remote summon feature may not work as smoothly as expected. 
Parking Camera: Image quality of the parking camera can be choppy and low-resolution. 
Braking: The brake pedal can feel spongy, requiring more pressure to stop the vehicle. 
Handling: Some reviewers have noted that the added weight of the battery can negatively impact handling, making it feel top-heavy. 
Build Quality: While generally satisfactory, build quality and fit/finish can still be improved. 
Service: Tata's after-sales service can be inconsistent, with some owners experiencing delays in parts availability and warranty claims. 
Missing Features: Some desirable features like a head-up display and rear AC vents are missing."

"Nice good to know they are included 10mts Cabel MCB and RCD

Copper is much reliable on this. Aluminum do suffer this issue."
Try it ...some dealers will deliver earlier than this.. there is no harm in trying?
"They ll issue refund, no issue with it, if I go to a new dealer my delivery ll be even delayed"
"Book from somewhere else then ask for refund, they will get in line."
"If your wire length is 30‚Äì40 meters, using 6 mm¬≤ may no longer be safe or efficient ‚Äî it can cause 3‚Äì4% drop, which is significant. That‚Äôs why most & tata also recommend 10 mm¬≤ copper for longer runs."
"That depends on dealer to dealer, not everyone does this, pls talk to ur dealer"
"Thanks for sharing your thoughts. Just to clarify ‚Äî wire length absolutely matters, even if the cable size is technically sufficient.

It‚Äôs not only about heating, but also about voltage drop, which increases with length and current. Especially for high-load applications like EV charging (7.2 kW @ 31 A) running for hours, even a 1‚Äì2% voltage drop can cause:

Reduced charging speed
Higher power losses
Overheating 
Long-term fire risk if insulation degrades"
They will start loan process and will get confirmed on insurance before processing loan
"Plz note. Aluminum cables are very cheap and used everywhere by discom, only issue is do not match sqmm of copper with aluminium.
It will heat up and damage if done so. Always oversize for aluminum, and joints to be avoided. Use mcb for joints."
"I double checked. Our 10 Kw solar plant. Which supports 13Kw generation uses 10 sq mm armour cable. 
Length is 7 story building. Almost 90 feets , 30 meters."
"Being a engineer Wire length doesn't matter unless u use undersized cables. 

Undersized cable works fine for short length. If length increased it will heat up more."
"Upto 7.4 Kw. 
Single ph works.

11 -22 Kw , 3 ph compulsory"
They are not mentioning wire length...
Details given here
"My recommendation:
6 sq mm Polycab or similar brand cable can support 7-11 Kw. 
2.5 or 4 sq mm good for 3.3 Kw. 

Avoid joints and lose contacts. Use rated MCB."
"How to Respond to Forced Insurance: 

**1. 1. Politely Refuse:** Inform the dealer that you will be sourcing your insurance from another provider.¬† 
**2. 2. Seek Alternative Quotes:** Get quotes from other insurers, either online or through other agents, to compare prices and coverage.¬†  
**3. 3. Report to IRDAI:** If the dealer continues to pressure you, file a complaint with the IRDAI. You can reach IRDAI through their toll-free numbers: 155255 or 1800 4254 732.¬†  
**4. 4. Report to CCI:** If the dealer's actions are deemed anti-competitive, you can also report them to the Competition Commission of India (CCI).¬†"
"Our borewell motors works for 6-8 hours daily on 4 sq mm aluminum , carry upto 12 Amp current."
"Doesn't matter. Aluminum heats up or any joint, contact is lose that will heat up. If wire size is less than recommended it will heat up."
This confirms upto 22 Kw. 6 sq mm wire works.
"But we are charging for 11 hrs. 
Considering  max temp 45¬∞C. And wire length might be more than 20 m


6 mm can get work done, but For safer side 10 mm is more reliable option."
""
"After booking, you can ask the dealership team for survey 

They will check your household load and tell you if you require to increase your meter load
And they will also tell you about charger setup and installation queries and guidelines 
And all this is free

So my suggestion is get the team to do the survey and ask the professional about these queries"
"Yes. You can..they can't force you to buy charger or insurance from them.
Only they can suggest"
To avoid any heating issue in future
I think for 7.2 kWh charger 10 sq mm copper cable required
Ohh is it for top end then
"10 sq mm copper is too much man. 6 sq mm is recommended and more than sufficient for 7.4 ACFC. 

10 sq mm aluminum is fine."
"I am planning to do the same
But in this case delivery was put on hold as per message"
"At the time of final payment, or delivery."
"I done same. ACFC and insurance from outside , for sure. 

Plz note. Do not argue now let the vehicle get alloted to ur booking. Then u can refuse and convey that u need outside insurance."
that‚Äôs what I am saying they generally match it as they don‚Äôt want to loose commission but forcing to buy at premium is illegal we can make a complaint.
"Why illegal? You can charge premium for anything...its free market.

My dealer also said they will match the quote."
"Take min 10 mm copper wire, your car will charge around 10-12 hrs and there is hot weather issue.

Some chargers have switchable load you can switch between 3.6 to 7.2 kw and cost around 20-30k.

Anyone can do wireing and the cost of wire is not that much.


I will also take insurance and charger from outside."
generally dealers matches the amount almost as they get commission 10-20% even on that and also at every renewal that‚Äôs why dealers do not want to for go the insurance part
Let me ask simple question when insurance is available at 50-60 k outside and if dealer ask the same for 1 lac isn‚Äôt that illegal?

"hello all, need your honest opinion. I am getting a second hand deal on mg zs ev executive model, (current on road price in rajasthan is 19 lakhs), blue smart EV fleet company owned, currently personally registered not taxi registered. All battery health and NOC checked by insurer and MG dealer. 
i am getting last price of 11 lakhs with insurance and three years TP. It is 7 months old. 
Should i go for it?"
Now they are offering for free 7.3kw
Thhey have installed electric pay 3.2kwh already across the whole society. That takes 20 plus hrs for harrier ev to get charged. Should look to speak to increase the load thr..
"True. This is Service wire which is the main line. It has to be 10 mm copper. Equivalent aluminum will be much thicker. 
Internal wiring from the Service wire to fuse/mcb/meter should be of 6 sq.mm."
If you are in Gated society request RWA to install couple of 7.2kw public charger inside society as MG and many other companies are providing chargers free of cost. Installing in personal parking space is gonna be extremely difficult and expensive.
"Bangalore is no way near other states. They don't wanna give flat road tax exemption they have 25L below cars only. Same as electricity they don't do these good stuffs, like other states. They want money."
Dont go if distance is more
Only upto 25 meters you can go with tata 7kw
I even talked with regional manager
U have to install based on rules written
They will not listen to anything
Not with tata 7kw
Can I get the wire from outside?
Otherwise go with statiq or zevpoint and install ur own connection
Be ready with 1.2 to 1.3 lakh rupees
My meter is almost 150 meters away from my parkingüôà
Unless its 10 sq mm they wont give 7kw speeds
They literally dont listen
""
Wait i recheck and send SS
No if it's aluminum 10 sq mm.and copper 6 mm
Literally lootenge
If u have more than 20 meters dont go with tata
They will loot u
To avoid confusion im going with tata charger itself so the tech knows which wire to use and all that stuffs
Dont ask
Statiq and zevpoint comes with 2 years max. Do get this in warranty card written
And how much they charge for extra wire?
Tata charger comes with 3 year warranty
If u insist on 6 sq mm they will trip down speed to 3kw
Thanks
Its written in their approval form
Based on these facts I'm going with tata installation itself
They dont care whether its copper or aluminium
They wont install unless its 10 sq mm sir
Not only the load matters. The wiring from bus bar to meter should also be of 6mm copper to take the 7.2 kw load. Otherwise it will burn the wiring/ meter.
Yes
Oh then increasing load to 8KW will be better to get 7.2 kwh charging
ü§£ü§£
Shhh dnt tell this. Its their hidden secret
They can manage 7kw charger with 4kw too. But it will charge at 3kw only
Yes
Tata 7kw?
Which charger?
"Incase of harassment, call customer care register a complaint against the dealer.
18002098282"
Have you increased the sanction load for 7.2? One of the eb guy said we can manage 7.2 charger with 4KW load. But im worried tha it must not bring any future fine in my eb bill
Okay. üëç
Then decided for chemical earthing. Now its working flawlessly
Then for some jugad to workout for few days i even poured salt water
Its always leaking
Water line goes from there only. And we all know quality of govt water lines
Tried putting water around the pit? Best thing is plant a flower plant near to earth pit and water the plant regularly.
So was tripping
My previous coal+salt used to increase after 2 hrs of charging
Chemical earthing is mostly used in industries and is very stable
This is the official limit they say.
After it started tripping i switched to chemical
Checked
No works at 10V too
7.2 will work till 3 volt N-E volt.
Not the coal+salt one
I made my own chemical earthingüòÇ in just 1200 rupees
Anyhow i have decided to increase the sanction load to 8KW to manage this 7.2KWh charger and house hold supply
I get this much at my setup
"Mostly in new societies with 3 phase connections, they provide proper earthing."
Never checked but i got to know this
7kw might trip at 15V
3kw will work till 30 V
7kw earthing requirement is little harsher
No need of extra earthing if your current set up is okay.
Kindly clarify this as you have installed a 7.2 charger. Does the earthing need to be done for this setup? Even if the existing earthing is fine.
Yes. It's free even now. Pl check with your dealer.
Even now included with 50K charger
Bigger batteries needs 7kw
15 meter wire + mcb + charger + installation all included
Yes. That was 3 years back and free. Iam also getting my 7.2 kw installation free for new nexon45. In mumbai.
Yes included
Installation is included in that price
Its for safety
I checked with Service centre guy and he said everything included in 50K
Else no 7kw
But if u buy 7kw from tata then they will force u to upgrade ur wiring to 10 sq mm
üôÅ
i already checked with my electrician and he said 2k to 3k
Yes
Yes
"Sir, i remember u mentioned that you have a ev. Is the installation done by tata at that time?"
no they are charging more
electrician will check and confirm
üòÆüòÆ
"Free installation is not available now. That was for Nexon.

Is any dealer providing free installation?"
Better go with tata as they will provide free cable and free installation. This is going to cost few thousands.  They are more qualified than the local electrician are authorized representative of Tata power.
I'm in a apartment and earthing is proper here with three phase so for this 7.2 charger they don't need any earthing to be done again right?
any experts here?
only thing idk is what would be the capacity of wire that should be installed
and extend a wire from your main box to the point of installation
he has to ensure earthing is done
This is std installation and any decent exp guy can do it
"Can u guarantee that you ll get a proper technician if u opt for ACFC, either of the option u can‚Äôt say about technician, but I hope they ll be having required knowledge in both cases"
that too at last min leaving them no choice
Don't tell the dealer that you will not purchase insurance from them. Instead take a quote from outside and ask them to match it. They won't match it and you will be free to take insurance from outside.
And installation
Ok but more worried how the outside electrician will understand the charger setup
Obliviously
i shared audio as well earlier
i spoke to tata engineer from pune and he agreed that more than tata these companies one are more reliable
"Let the customer decide on it, not the dealer"
"If u opt for ACFC, u ll not get Tata‚Äôs charger, that‚Äôs too 3rd party - exicom"
Statiq and ZevPoint is very good
more reliable than tata one
I'm not sure how third party portable chargers will work
thats costly in 33k u can get it done
But till now they have not insisted me to buy insurance and ACFC..
Insurance is fine we can opt from outside but installation of 7.2 Kwh i prefer to be with TATA itself as everything including installation will be 50K so they check proper earthing and safety
I have already told them that i will not take insurance from them.. and also cancelled ACFC last week.. so i think thats why my delivery date is now showing dec 25.. they are delaying delivery for those who not opting insurance and ACFC from them...
We all should unite and raise it to TATA about dealer issues
i will ask him
during the vehicle delivery i will tell him
i did nt tell him that i will not take insurance from him
Can I have details?
"My delivery was on hold as I refused to take insurance with dealer, this is not at all acceptable, being second customer to book from that dealer"
our Kishan has all that info
"Not sure who ll be point of contact to raise such issues about dealer with manufacturer, anyone have any contact from TATA"
It should come to around 2 rs
"Dealers are forcing to buy ACFC & insurance from them, giving false commitments to customers like outside charger will void battery warranty, outside insurance ll not cover battery and its customer own risk etc"
This is very cheap
And monthly fixed charges of 500
In Maharashtra there is flat 4.5 rs per unit for ev meter..
idk why he is asking repeatedly r u happy and r u seeing any issues

No issues anyone who has an idea can share their thoughts. Also now the units differ for every 100 units and after increasing the load it will be same or it starts from 10rs every unit
No idea sir. I still have to figure that out. Need to pay ppl in electric company and have to do multiple follow ups. This is wat I heard when I did my initial checks. But how much exactly need to check. But home meter for ev charger will be sure shot less than 10rs per kWh. As most of the public chargers are more than 10 rs for publick ac chargers.
Sure thanks and post that how unit charge will be calculated? And approx how much we need to spend on to increase load and installation of third party 7.2Kwh charger
I think it should be ok. But better to get a 8kw sanctioned load.
No it's 3kwh. As is said I have a single phase connection for my 2bhk in gated society.
For 7.2 kwh charger 7KW load is fine?
So now your EB sanction load is 7Kwh
"My understanding is, I have a single phase connection as I am in a gated community society. My sanctioned load is 3kwh and I was told if I need to put an ev wall charger I need a separate meter connection sanctioned. If I use it in my same current home meter, it would draw more load and cause issue to the appliances and to the meter connection. Also this will invite trouble from my electric company to put heavy fine. So I need a separate meter for ev wall charger. In that case i should get a separate meter connection for more than 7kwh for using 7.2kwh. I could be wrong, but this is my understanding."
Few say that if we have 3 phase in our house and if we install a 7.2Kwh charger we don't need to increase the sanction load. While some say 7.2Kwh runs on a single phase only even if we have 3 phase so the sanction load needs to be increased. Which one is correct?
"Jist is we can buy our 7.2kwh acfc anywhere from anyone, not a compulsion that we need to buy from showroom. Warranty won't come into picture. Provided 4:1 ration is followed. 4 dc should be followed by a ac charging. Also three main points for warranty are. 
1. Car should be always connected with ira app.
2. Service should be done only with tata authorised service centers 
3. No physical damage to the battery."
Very helpful conversation. Will be more helpful if you could give the gist in English. Many more can understand.
Okay upto 8-10 meter length
Any. They havent mentioned. But 10 sq mm is mandatory

Suzuki shines not Evitara. Suzuki knows nerves of Indian Middle class.
10 sq mm aluminum or copper ? Must be Armour aluminum
This looks like 2.5 sq mm 3 core. Ok for 3.3 kw or 4 ke load.
That is where evitara shines for Indian customers..
Most indian people wants budget friendly cars
evitara / eEscudo customers are not tata Mahindra customers. Impact will be minimal
Mahindra is always focused on costly cars. Thats where they lag masses
"They are going to show new model concepts and new platform form. New lanuches other than new bolero is unlikely to happen.
Other ev lanuch is Xev 7e , the electric version of xuv 700. Since it's a 7 seater , it's price is going to be above XEV 9e or same. Hence no price advantage. And new features are very difficult to add , since these cars are already very loaded"
Else they wont install charger
10 sq mm is compulsory if charger is from tata exicom

"Yes, it's low seated"
Xev9e has zero body roll
"But definitely body roll is lower than endeavor, scorpio and fortuner even XUV 700."
"If you are used to sedan, hatchback and low CG cars, you will take time to get used to it. It's with all high seated SUVs except for Q series Audi and to an extent in X series BMW"
What about handling - exactly what they mean by that? Is that a major drawback?
"I think when you are sitting at this height, even Land Cruiser gives body roll."
"No, Curvv"
Curvv
Yes
For harrier ?
"Yes, but the internal space is compromised and rear view is worst and no camera"
They say curvv handling was better then harrier
"My current car is CR V, which is almost similar size and shape and known for ride quality.

I would say it's almost same ride quality except the interior finish is low which is bearable"
You can enable subtitles
For me I'm totally Happy with yeh comfort and ride. But they mostly complain about rear seat that needs to be clarified
Then that is one point we need to test and clarify
No
In this podcast they mentioned the handling and body roll. You guys tested on highways?
https://youtu.be/fKeWWQl0NSo?si=lO6DiwRzZWow-y81
When compared with current car astor its little heavy but not a big diff
I was comparing with my current daily driver ( Tata Hexa) and the drive quality was better.
Body roll for its weight is common but not significant is what i heard
"Few car influencers mention handling and body roll issues in the harrier ev. Especially in highways, While on the test drive i didn't find any such discomfort. Does anyone have suggestions over this?"
That‚Äôs true but but if you see spy photos it‚Äôs looking big
"Ok
Sharing in sometime"
Sierra will be 5 seated or may be even 4 seated
So imo if you can charge twice 40 to 100% in a week then portable charger is enough
And overnight charging is also a comfortable option then why should we go with ACFC
"Actually I have to buy prepaid meter of Rs . 15 k and 6 sq mm 3 core copper cable around 80 meter and other mcb, switch and installation cost approx 3 k

So the total cost of 3.3 kv will very high"
"IMO ACFC is not about how much we r driving, it‚Äôs about comfort of charging @ home"
After 40-50% batery we can charge 100% overnight
If running is less than 600 km in a week then  why should we go with ACFC

True...2.5 lcs extra for matte is insane...

"The current wiring might not be suitable, and if it‚Äôs not, you will get penalized for drawing more load than what‚Äôs approved. 


 best approach is to run a separate 10 mm wire from your meter to the garage

wire thickness also depends on the distance"
"Yes u can reduce the Kw setting. 
I brought Zevpoint 7.2 kw charger. And I am able to see setting and able to set at any Kw. From 7.2 kw, 32 am to 10 am, 2 Kw."
for me also PPF cost outweighs the benefits
7.75 bro for IB floating rate
Spot correction can be done
Great then u can use. But better to just pay some charged and increase the load to 7kw. They ask for more deposit. Wires and meter will be same
"Will take some time to get the higher capacity connection. Till then, will the 7.2 KW ACFC charge at 3.5 KW?"
"In Noida.
This is a separate meter for parking. Not shared with home."
"Are you thinking scratches in India is impossible ?

Plz note it draws upto 32 Amp current. Reduce its KW if not needed.

"Which state,

It will work. Ensure u use 10 sq mm aluminum or 6 sq mm copper for wiring. Mcb needed 40 amps.

Not sure about other state harrier diesel is 32.5 lac top model Bangalore and harrier EV costing much lesser having more features and future proof upfront saving of 1 lac against diesel.
"That is why Harrier.ev pricing is good
On road it is cheaper than XUV 700, Harrier Diesel, Safari Diesel & XEV 9E 

plus empowered 75 RWD is just +60k more than BE 6 Pack 3 79
So instead of BE 6, Harrier gives more space, stance and size plus feature"
Decided going with harrier EV
"dont go for it, if planning, facelift is round the corner"
I quoted the standard pricing before any discounts and stock clearing
suspension wise safari is ahead
they offered me 29.5 top end diesel last month xuv 700 I believe they are clearing the stock
"no hate for safari, but their diesels are sluggish, mahindras diesel are on another level"
Agreed but if you compare safari looks more premium
Tata should have been cautious on pricing - could have done decent 5 K

Did u get the test drive ?
Upto 7 years
Repayment period in Indian bank
Yes and 10m wire too
?
Tenure?
"Indian bank 7.75% (floating and can be pre closed any time)
Charges 2500
Vetting charges 1100
No stamp duty
Bob has stamp duty"
Check pnb 7.9 ROI and 10 year repayment period.
It does help only problem if scratches happen then that panel one to replace at their own cost
Sten is a brand
So 50 k extra for ACFC includes installation too?
"Free if you buy through Tata
Rest I don't know"
How much will the installation charges be if we buy a portable 7.2 kw charger
"So you are paying around 2.3L -2.5 L for harrier ev stealth editon. 

Also does ppf really help or its gimmicks?"
What is difference between ppf and this one ?
I got quote of 1.6L for Sten which is top quality and 10 yrs warranty
"Thats true, ppf is must and is also costly"
"Is it true that stealth or matte colors are difficult to maintain in the long run, and scratches are more visible and harder to fix compared to gloss finishes?"
"Getting 8.45 % from BOB With Partpayment facility from day 1 and Zero FC Charges !! 

Anyone got lesser than this ?"
"For any battery capacity above 60kW, it is stupidity to only depend on 3.3kW for home charging 
XEV 9E 79kWh customers already are saying car takes close to 30 hours to full charge using this

Harrier EV would still require 24-25 hours for it atleast considering 75kWh

If you don't want 7.2 kW charger from Tata, buy it from Amazon or through static, zeon etc.

Because eventually everyone will shift from 3.3 kW to 7.2 kW charger in few months due to long charging time

And then you would be doing entire charger installation again
Double expense"

Voltage protector and 40 A mcb also installed.
"Guys I have installed power plug and Zevpoint 7.2 Kw charger at my parking. 
10 sq mm aluminum which I was having in stock is used. 6 sq mm copper is recommended."
U need normal power plug. Which any electrician can install. Will cost less than 1k including labour.
"For 3.3 Kw , 2.5 sq mm works fine. 4 sq mm will be better choice."
""
there is no need to install anything for 3.3 kwh..its portable charger..just use atleast 4 to 6 mm wire...
I believe we don't need tata to setup anything for 3.3 kWh chargers if you have good earthing and a 15A socket just plug in charge
Please confirm that if we don't buy ACFC then Tata will install a 3.3kwh charger setup at our home or we need to pay for it additionally.
Did not reset trip at that time

You can also try Tata Aig. They usually quote the lowest for new cars compared to others.
Yes sir
"Just confirm it. They had 2 types of plans. 1. Saver plan where the premium is less but you need to pay 5k against each claims. This makes it unvaiable for small repair claims of 10- 15 k.

2. Standard plan where premium slightly higher and you need to pay only 2k against claims."

Hey everyone,

Sharing my recent experience with **Acko Insurance**. After hearing good things, I tried contacting their customer care for some clarifications. They asked me to email them, but as the screenshot shows, my email has been unanswered for a week. When I asked about their office in my city, the customer care seemed clueless.

This lack of responsiveness has me concerned. So, I'm now opting for **SBIGEN policy through TATA** instead.

Just wanted to share for anyone considering Acko.

Is it ? But it shouldn‚Äôt be so ideally
Sir ur views
"Checked KIA carnival 

Wiring is seen 

Checked Seltos 


Same"
Then this SC is useless
"I checked for Safari & Harrier ICE 
For diesel they have stealth 
As per service repainting, charges are same"
Atleast 40% more
"Cost is not same, for stealth black its more"
"Took 2nd test drive today, Boost mode is Boom üí• Adas radar wiring is visible. Tested auto parking and the accuracy is top notch."
Sharing this because there was a lot of HOHAA on tyre life and all before !!
"Gst hi nhi h ispe to kaise benefit ho sakta h , gst ka h na army personnel ke liye rule to"

In case of repainting, cost is same

All are assumptions only
Still didn't get proper RWD range videos
I have booked white only
With red drl it looks good in harrier
Yes definitely. White gives a grand look
"White and oxcide looks totally different 
Since white has gloss it immediately catches your eyes attention"
true that
Nocturne also double shade so will be costly
That is his own perspective im just asking if he felt any difference in white n oxide
repainting is extra for oxide for stealth black if its 5500 for general for stealth black it will be 8000 these r ball park nos
"Sir - no offences - But  I really wonder how well trained are these SA to give any bull sh*t to consumers ! 

Every Shade comes with a Shade code auth by Tata!!!"
Yes
thats true
i will share its my wifey mobile
My dealer said in oxide in future if we need to paint it might be hectic and white will be best
take white or go for any other color
small diff
i would say white and oxide has no diff
for me he said he will get it the color of my choice under 2 weeks
I'm confused between white n oxide my dealer says oxide is similar to nexon oxide
Can u share some pics or vid. Any vid pic i see both oxide and white are almost same. Too near
go for QWD or leave it üôÇ
only QWD bro
in curv there was a red color that could have been given
Qwd or rwd?
If you have taken pics kindly share
Grey i may opt for
Stealth Black and Grey are looking good but Black has manitenance issues
Yes i have seen all colors
Oxide looks the best
"Did you notice white, oxide colors this time and how it looks?"
only major problem is color options

In csd tata evs of 25 lakhs only give 20k benifits ....and in ice under 10 lakh get 1-1.5 lakh benifits.....because of gst

It‚Äôs 5 seater
So Tata is going to make deliveries for next 6 months
"Sierra will be 5 seater with optional 4 seater variant

Size will be around creta 4300 mm but height will be more"
Sierras top end will end at 23 or 24 and may start from around 17 to 18 lakhs
I think sierra is 5 seater and size is that of creta around 4300 mm.
Sierra is 7 seater

"For safer side, you should go for 75 kw if you don't want to stop for charging. You must avoid the last 10% atleast. In future there can be some degradation and or even Tata advice not to drive below 10% as far as possible"
some people really like harriers look over safari and say safari looks odd. so that can be reason
"i personally think its related to looks of car more than anything else. I would rather travel alone in safari than harrier, just because of looks of safari. So that may be the reason"
It's huge in city I experienced for Mumbai
as per tatas claim
"in ICE fuel efficiency is not major difference, barely half a km to litre"
"The reason here is fuel efficiency and maintainance cost.

Which is completely different for an EV"
"or may be smaller families prefer harrier, like 3 to 4 peole"
some people actually like harriers look comapred to safari
may be because harrier is 150mm smaller than safari
as idk
wanted to understand the reason
Yeah but you still see Harrier right
as difference is just 50k between all variants of harrier and safari
the same reason why people still but harrier ICE over safar ICE
hmm then why will someone buy harrier
yes
top end to top end?
"i highly doubt that, it will be max 50 to 70k higher than harrier"
but it will go beyond 35L as per my expectation
"Yep, in EV size doesn't matter for efficiency"
range will be like 20 to 30 km less max as its just a 100 kgs diffference. the same difference that is there in qwd and RWD
"yeah same here, also personally like safaris look more, looks proportionate"
For that difference I would definitely go for safari if range is similar
yeah i checked its just 50k difference between the two
"in harrier and safari ICE, difference is just 70k i think , so same will be there in EV as well"
For sure it will touch 35 lac ex showroom

"FYI, sharing again"
that‚Äôs the issue you shouldn‚Äôt buy an insurance from the company who is not giving you in writing.
"Brother, open acko website and select your city, enter the car details. You‚Äôll get a callback from acko team. Ask all your doubts and get a quote(which is same for everyone buying same variant)"
These terms are not in writing from any insurance company. When you invest 30 lakh you obviously have fear of coverage
Yes we are in this group to be aware and make others aware I agree that showroom people are telling same creating FOMO
"What knowledge u need? I shared couple of times that I received an email from ACKO on this, not myself alone, some other shared too"
Showroom people promote themselves to buy there premium insurance..
"Yeah, true"
"If it so, then they‚Äôll fall into the trap of dealerships"
"I am just telling what the showroom told me, if you have knowledge please tell us.

If any external damage to battery, will this be covered?"
Exactly
"These people are creating unnecessary confusion in the group without proper knowledge, I have shared an email from ACKO earlier too"
"All of these come under zero dep, if you still need confirmation talk to customer care once"
Pls do not comment without any knowledge.
It‚Äôs a click bait

"Dears, i am planning to buy the 65 KWH variant. What will be the expected range any idea?"
Or else live with it

These are very tough to manage in long time
All these kind of good ettiquettes i followed with Astor but didnt give me any good results
""
Yes cashless
Do they also have cashless facility for Tata?
ACKO imo
So then which insurance is best for Harrier EV with full battery protection?
10 to 100 is recommended and for better life 20 to 100
So ac charging from 20 to 100 is the optimal?
No boost mode in rwd variant..
"i dont think there is any boost mode in rwd variants?, or is there"
"It is recommended to always charge to 100%
If not everytime, atleast once a month to keep cells balanced
And never do deep discharge 
Always charge once battery is near 20%"
"LFP batteries are tested for 8000-10000 cycles

For reference if you charge and discharge complete battery daily, it will be 365 times in a year
To reach 8000 cycles you will need more than 20+ years"
"okay thanks, and is it overall healthy for battery to charge like this?"
"Charging cycle is counted from 100% discharge to 100% charge
That is one cycle
If you charge from 60% - 90%, and then discharge some %, again charge it, it doesn't make it as 1 cycle"
"just out of curiosity, how are charging cycles calculated?, like my car is charged 100%, i drove for 200km, came back with 50% and plugged in 3.3 kw charger for lets say till 80%. again drove for another 100 km, once again let it charge till 90%. 
So will all be counted as cycles. 
And does this kind of charging badly effect battery life? Should i take the car till lets say 10-20% and then make sure to charge till 100%?"
"It's a common thing by OEMs

They will target another OEM whose sales are good and they want a pie from it
In case of EVs, Tata is the leader
And even in ICE, they are doing really good

Same happens with Maruti, even if they do good, people will troll their cars
Look at Brezza and grand Vitara.
Brezza scored 4 star in GNCAP when it was launched vs Creta 3 star
Still people will call Brezza as unsafe because it is from Maruti and will praise Creta"
"To the opposite, my experience with Mahindra has been bad for my XUV 700
No resolution for multiple visits, long time in service centre"
"thats great to hear, its too bad only tata is targeted for bad service. I mean they are 2nd or 3rd largest car seller in India. If service was this bad why would people buy. Its very strange that tata is only targeted."
"It is nowhere as bad as it is hyped
Just watch this customer video of Harrier ev
He has never faced any service issue for his Nexon EV
I own Nexon Diesel and my family owns a Safari
We have never faced a single issue"
A few things he mentioned About rusting that needs to be discussed Does anyone who owns a tata car face such an issue?
"why is tata's service so badly talked about, have never owned a tata, so really curious, have rarely seen good reviews about tata service. I mean whats the issue, do they overcharge, or cannot solve the issues, or are not interested in solving the issue or somethijng else?"
"Clickbait titles

"Yes , set of 4 how can you expect each tyre cost 60,000 to 1,00,000 ü§£ü§£"
"Yeah thats a good point , lets see"
I think 18 inch is better with good side wall support . Tyre burst will be less.
"Because in my personal opinion, these ev tyres are really not grippy at all. They loose grip so quickly, and that can be risky in a rwd setup. So if allowed i will go for normal tyres for ev then this ev biased tyre if range takes a hit of 10% , i am okay with it."
"We should not deviate with company recommendation, else insurance n manufacturer are eagerly waiting to void the claims"
"No sure on this, but cost will be definitely high for big tyres."
"And what if just install normal tyres, i am okay with a little tyre sound. How much will lets say michelin highway tyre drop range ?"

"Also, in all reviews, at 1% it's showing a range of 39 km. Maybe the reserve range is higher this time, no idea how far it will go...

"472 was for 110%, in 100% he got around 430-440..."
Mumbai
Which location
1st August
When will deliveries commence from ? Any idea ?
Which city?
Test drive vehicle itself is not available üòë
Any update on Harrier allotment?
Anything above 450 am ok with it
Glide suspension is Simply a Bliss for City Potholes
"Yes, I have. They are low rolling resistance tyres."
"Took test drive today

We have to insert sd card and we can get footage via Ira app or use card directly in mac, windows or any device"
Ev tyres are specialised tyres for aerodynamic and efficient to get more range.. have you seen harrier.ev tyres that has label electricdrive from Goodyear
"EV tyres have comparatively more life. Not sure about the price though.

Non ev MRF 19 inch tyres costed me 48000."
Drive power affects range
"Nexon again coming in my mind. Due to Low maintenance. 

This confirms Harrier is not made for middle class or upper middle class. 
The family who have 25+ Lk worth car, they can easily afford this. 

Being Honda City petrol user for so many years. I haven't paid more than 5-10 K for yearly service, and haven't paid more than 25K for tyres that also after 50 k kms."
"QWD is not for everyone 

RWD - 65/75KW will be the most efficient of the lot!"
""
https://youtu.be/srZfydEdZFM?si=-jGYQPMfuYrdBn_H
This guy drove sensibly. Qwd 470 in most highway. City with regen and ac and off qwd itself will touch 500 and rwd will be better too.
"And the 19 inch wheels cost will be 60,000 goes upto 1,00,000 rupees based on brand‚Ä¶"
Did anyone got vehicle allocated?
Even our 2018 model Hyundai i20 asta op top end not able to go beyond 35k kms. Due to thin tyre side wall. And excess weight.
"Agree with this point. Tyre wear will be High for offroading , drag race or quick speeding.

Expect 30-35 K kms for normal uses."
"Is this true ,that big suv ev car tyres wear so easily?"
""
""
""
"Those taking a test drive‚Äîcan you confirm if we can access e-IRVM recordings via the Tata app, or do we have to take out the SD card manually?"
"In adaptive cruise control, both motors are working. That's why it's consuming more power."
"I guess with an update, Tata will refine it in future...."
Speed very much affects range..... 60 to 80 gives the best range I guess and 120 probability 30% to 40% less range
"I have 45K color yellow LED for my Honda City. And it's very powerful. Upgraded halogens them for just 6 k , watts are around 80 watts. Equals to 220w of halogen. As mentioned."
I m not sure what is watts for AC. But it may b 1 kw per hour. Try to keep car or home AC at 24 degree. It will save big.
For me they promised 45 days delivery but still they didn't even display cars in Tamilnadu üòë
Is there any dealer commit delivery date in July for empowered 75 RWD??
I am going to get my test drive tomorrow
"In QWD variant, cruise control eats up the battery"
""
"It‚Äôs just like ICE cars, more speed then less mileage"
Speed affects range
That speed effects it and at 80 it gives good mileage
Every review or people in diff forum says the same thing
Pickup does
Speed doesnt affect range
We should see if someone drives around 80 ish and see how much does it gives
472 range

"My personal opinion is that white led lights are bad for visibility in rain/fog, but now days all manufacturers are going for led set-up. As per most reviews online, Harrier's Bi-leds have good low beam but high beams are not good.

Must watch
This guy video is too motivating üòÄ
""
This guy drove 180 kmph üò¨
Sure
You should first exp that sir
No need to use any modes.. you just drive normally. Modes are for disposal special off-road situations. Not for regular car drive
"EVs in ghat roads
Going uphill - regen off . Or zero.
Downhill - regen 2 or 3 depending on the speed of decent, elevation and. Traffic. Regen 3 best for controlled decent"
"Any mode should do, not much to think of"
No need to shift anything like in manual cars. It is tuned to climb automatically at a speed of 6/8 kms without accelerator in put.
Im asking for RWD75
But which mode to use here..! Those 4 terrain modes or sports mode or normal drive itself will help vehicle in hills.
"I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any sort of manual shifts, I used paddle shifters in TD only to upshift/downshift regen levels"
I have another doubt kindly clarify - in the harrier which mode to use in hills. In manual or automatic i use to reduce gear to climb hills but in this i can see padle shifter for regen only is that for reducing gear too?
"If you are basing buying decision of a normal family car meant to be driven in normal Indian roads based of its top speed limit of 180 km , I don't know what to say..ü§∑ü§∑"
"If you are planning too use ev long term , NMC battery in creta (and clavis ) and 8 years warranty vs life time don't make any sense."
We can play videos from smart variant itself..
Thanks for putting out here
They are getting better definitely useful in expressways not in state highways or other roads.
This is smartly put it under carpet
Arcade.ev starts from Adventure S version itself
Have used adas and it was not helpful
But ADAS is waste on indian roads
I meant bakras who get vehicles in the first lot
So in highways if feel tired we can use randomly
Definitely
But continuous cruising will impact in range right? There is a difference between our manual acceleration and cruise right?
Since India is opening up more expressways imo it is must have feature
RWD I don't think right now available anywhere
You can drive for like sometime 100 km without pressing acceleration or brake pedal.
QWD
In other variant we can't play videos on screen
One more important features is only in top variant that while we charge it outside we can see movie on screen and enjoy the movie with Dolby Atmos
RWD?
In many videos we saw screen was not working or the rear view mirror was not properly working but I feel that the operation of the screen and mirror was smooth
Same 140 was my top speed in the 12 yrs of driving experience üòä
Even I took test drive today and it was really very comfortable
"Yes in when driving in expressways you will definitely miss this, It‚Äôs the only feature I like is useful in adas others are just ok."
Is it really useful as i have not driven any adas vehicle previously
I decided to go for empowered only for ADAS that too particularly due to adaptive cruise control.
Reason?
I am also going going for empowered 75 RWD
Even i thought of moving to fearless + 75 But 1.5 laksh more gives multiple features so going for Empowered 75 RWD not sure how many features will be useful in real time
If tata harrier satisfies the basic needs that is more than enough for me.
Yes
We shouldn‚Äôt be discussing this India üòÅ
"Yes 

It ensures - If at all it HITS to an Object for obvious reasons - Insurance folks Checks the OBD to release the claim report to decline üò¨"
Yes but 180 itself too much for Indian highways
You must explore 9E then
"Hey 

Can u share any of their YT Videos"
Lets wait guinea pig reviews
Trying to tick as many boxes as possible
Otherwise it's death speed. No 5 star safety will save u.
Big deal would have been 400 mileage
"I never went above 160 kmph. It's my all time high. üòÇ

Really not botherer even if Govn capd all the vehicles at 150 kmph top. I wish they should."
Not a big deal though
Yeah agree but sometimes dil toh bacha hein jiii
"I don't know how many of us will go 180 200s constantly. For an adrenaline rush once or twice, will we go more than tat?"
"Not much boss. If Headlamps are saying 100 watts. 
For 5 hour drive it can eat up 500 watts. Nothing but 0.5 Kw."
Sometimes short trip your heart may ask u to race
Xev it can go beyond 180
One more issue is speed is capped at 180
Thats unfortunately  true üòÑ
In RWD ACC will use only the single motor but in QWD it activates both motors that is why we saw low ranges in test drives
ACC comes into picture when u enable regular cruise
While driving if u dont turn on ACC then its ok
"All models have normal cruise control.
Only empowered models have Adaptive cruise control"
Always good to have cruise sometimes if its only 200km ur going then cruise can help
All have
75 RWD doesnt have cruise ?
Guys I was wondering if the range during night will reduce due to continuous usage of headlamps?
I'm also in for adv S 65
"More confusion in range between 75 QWD n RWD. QWD has lots of features to reduce it range like boost mode, dual motor, cruise sometimes activates both motors so range will differ a lot when compared to RWD. 75 RWD is more VFM and expecting the range to be around 500"
dealers incorrect
this is official website

"The Tata Harrier EV, specifically the variant with the 75 kWh battery pack, has a claimed ARAI range of 627 km (P1+P2). However, the estimated ""C75 range"" for this variant, which is considered a more real-world number, is between 480 km and 505 km"
the more we dig down its getting more complex
Yes. Weight and torque may b different
Curvv and Harrier almost same range then
That's good.
"Tata Curvv EV with a 55 kWh battery has a C75 range of 400-425 km, while its MIDC range is 502 km"
I think we can get that if we drive smoothly.
"So safe driving range without anxiety let's consider 
350 km for 65 Kw
420 km for 75 Kw. 

Take the decision wisely.
I am still IN for adv s 65 kw model."
450 to 470 is good 500 would have been great but still ok

2150000- 1 lakh = 2050000 can negotiate further 1 lakh i.e 2 lakhs discount on ex-showroom
Real world range was always 500 wondering what has changed and creta cant give 400 plus
"Reconsidering my choice of harrier ev , can't convince myself to send 27.5 for 500 range , Creta ev smart O LR 51.4 kWh gives range of 400+ on road also I got offer of 1 lakh on ex-showroom price. Only thing that I don't know is 51.4 vs 65 kWh and nmc vs lfp pls help"

Dont get me wrong its still confortable but continuous body movement is there

remove ZS EV üòÑ shutting down so dont even consider
Harrier ev test drive done?
Perhaps awaiting for customer reviews‚Ä¶
"Even I researched on Creta, zs ev,Windsor,nexon ev,mg hector, harrier diesel done test drives‚Ä¶ in terms of space + comfort and VFM is harrier ev"
"Due to weight of the battery on the floor, center of gravity is lower.. hence body roll and stability will be a lot more in EVs than corresponding ice models"
"In case of Harrier EV, it is cheaper on road vs Harrier Diesel

So it's already giving ROI from the day on purchase 
Over and above it is giving you low cost of running"
"For ICE cars
Nexon, Creta, XUV 700, Harrier all give same tank to tank range 

Doesn't mean other cars doesn't justify why they exist
My reason to buy a Creta after Nexon was space 

Now my reason to upgrade from Creta to Harrier is space + comfort + technology"
"I believe it's not made for budget user, Nexon , Punch serving well for those and recovering ROI faster. 

Harrier is made for enthusiastic users, who have other small cars too , but want to have SUV as well . The people who are owners of alcazar, endeavours, santafe, MG hector. 
Can easily think of Harrier as a VFM package. 

Yes our 25-30 not gonna ROI. So take decision wisely."
"This is the same car that was running on BIC track taking corners at 110-120 kmph
So don't listen to media or influencers
They forgot what they experienced just few week back at Buddh international Circuit

Everyone there said car handles like a sports car
Now suddenly not good üòÇ
They were given demo to limits"
But the point is do we need to spend 30L for 400 range? Yes harrier is heavy still there must be some reason to spend 28 to 30 L
"[Vishnu](tg://user?id=634950965) , u guys are missing one point. Harrier is proper full size SUV and curb weight is 2x. More the weight lesser the range. So we can expect 400+ similar like curvv."
Harrier ev has body roll high speed stability not good as Harrier diesel
"Nexon 45- 15-16 lakhs
Windsor pro 18-19 lakhs
Harrier 26-27 lakhs
All are having similar range (50-60km diff) having same basic features 
For highway running (daily running 60-70km ), no money issue , loan nahi Lena - no 1 choice
City running ( 40-50km daily)kabhi kabhi highway long trips
Comfort chahiye, design jo bhi ho chalega - windsor pro
City running and highway running (daily 40-50km) suv design hi chahiye, back seat mein space se koi jyada fark nahi , service centre ka dekh lenge - nexon 45
Daily running 20-30km , jyadatar khadi rehti hai - petrol gadi (12-15lakh) aur fir jaisi kurbat ho"
RWD will have better range than QWD anyday by atleast 40 - 50 km
thats right thats what am looking for
Most of these reviews will be of a single person driving. Only if they test with full load with 5 members we can predict the range if that comes near 450 + for RWD then üî•
Atleast we can say people can easily get 450+ km on highway if they are actually driving
yes and he said es creta ev me then I got confused that I am watching creta ev review or harrier EV üòÇ
"This guy only drove on highway 
Got 460+ km

In conclusion, people are getting range on highway, some people are not even getting range in city

"Yes saw this too. He was driving most of times in 100s, 95 to 100s, which he himself will agree at the end, still he got 417kms. So yeah this is still pretty decent. I am a person who drives in 80 to 90 in highways and in city with regen 3. 450 plus is pretty much ok."
https://youtu.be/VcaL_DgKzHw?si=7jfgRUEL3Aj4poGF
Only during high speed above 120 he felt body roll n bumpy and range drop. For a common man riding 100 it gives utmost comfort. Mostly family driving will be in city or eco so if RWD gives 480 it will be good with full packed n AC
From 34 mins the conclusion starts and it gives some hope.
https://youtu.be/D14yVFs3HKU?si=OCVlzywcGpoJBF80
Not at all. We all want a decent range for wat we are paying for.
EV market itself keeps changing for sure. 2026 will bring lot of latest techs for sure.
Am not too greedy
Was planning for QWD and if it gives me 450+ am up for it
Agree we need to wait for actual user reviews
I bought Astor and it was quite futuristic car then and we took it before thinking but 3 yrs later am.repenting because of fuel
Remaining was 10%

"Very sensible driving and review. Range test means to know how much the maximum not mix of sports booast especially, city I agree should be in it with regen definitely will u more. But this guy hardly went in cruise or qwd, most of the times 80s only. So he was able to achieve or touch near 500. The final avg energy consumption was around 165wh/kms, which is around 450. In city regen 3 it will touch 500, AC on and off will still boost the range."
simple why to complex things
also if they are giving verdict  they should give city and highway range separate and I‚Äôll calculate mixed usage range üòÅ
"I will stick to C75 Range by Tata for Harrier 
Till now all their cars have delivered their claim of C75 range, so I will trust Tata to improve only as this is their flagship product 

And then wait for actual owners to give range idea 
Not trusting any media or influencer for it now"
one thing you are not considering is that nexon is 900 kgs lighter than harrier.
Yes if you notice he realised that whenever he setting cruise control vehicle is delivering energy to front and rear both hence less range when he disabled then started getting good range.
Also I believe these are demo cars let‚Äôs wait for production cars in another 10-15 days we will see private car reviews
"The least  we can do is to after every 200KM we have a DC ready to charge up on those journey fully loaded. 

Just a bit of planning"
"Also realised one thing 

In Harrier EV, boost mode remains active always just like eco City sports

In Mahindra, boost mode is active only for 10 seconds

All reviewers tested Boost mode, only few switched back to other modes 
Many enjoyed boost mode for a long time

And then they gave a range verdict ü´°üò§, these so called reviewers have to go back to doing their honest job again"
This guys review made little sense
That‚Äôs not coming this year atleast.
AWD also we may see 450 minimum
I strongly believe RWD will fetch  500 km of range.
When did that released?
"Yesterday I saw a guy in youtube doing range test in sports mode.. media cars can't be a bench mark for range. Nexon 45 doing 350 plus easily and curvv 55 getting 400 , harrier 75 not getting above 450 is impossible unless driven very harshly/ uphill/ in sports mode"
"In my personal opinion, since the Nexon EV is able to deliver a 400+ km range with a 45 kWh battery pack in FWD, I believe the Tata Harrier EV, being an RWD with a 75 kWh battery pack, should be able to deliver a real-world driving range of around 500 to 550 km"
In real world we might not go below 30% or 20%
I have decided to hold for now till start getting owners reviews I also feel these some of the media people have abused the vehicle so in worst case if it is giving 400 than ok but can‚Äôt take risk.
"Siva sir, then we all have to wait for the real user reviews to come out post delivery. Cos I did not feel most of these media reviews just focusing on range. It was mixed for sure, which can't give the actual result which we are expecting."
Thats the test am looking for
Plys 20 to 30 km boost mode
With diff modes eco city modes
All am saying with proper 4*4 family n loaded fully luggage how much will it give with decent ac
Guys lets not think like that we should have open mind
"I have stopped looking those so called 2M and 3M Reviewers who have stopped doing what we expected them to do !!! 

Free air ticket !! 
Free 5 star stay and food and drinks !!! 

Have made them lazy and now lacking subject! 

Trust your instincts and experience!"
My main is xev9e fully loaded Bangalore price touching 35L and here touching somewhere around 31L so yeah compromises will be thr.
"Regen would have been, but hardly one or two reviews whr they did real range test to whom it was 400 plus rest all harrassed the car in the name of review testing. I don't blame them that's what they are supposed to do. Real user reviews post delivery will again change all our perspectives for sure."
"Welcome to the party sir 
üëçüëç"
"Adding to, complete single pedal is not thr. But still in regen 3 it's slowing the speed big time but not coming to complete hault, which is still ok. Few here and thr will be when comparing with xev9e the direct competitor. 400 plus in test is pretty ok and real time drive shud atleast try to touch near 500. Hopefully. M too planned to go for it"
Where it was used sensibly - Media Car has delivered satisfactory range
Regen was there right
"I have made up my mind finally 

Will go for Harrier.ev !! 

Missed opportunity 

1. Rear seat Reclining 
2. Single Pedal Drive mode 
3. White and grey shades 

But these miss outs I can still live with it for my use ! Because there is LOT which Tata has offered which I‚Äôm
Sure competition will follow"
"For a SUV of 2.4 Tones KW 
With QWD on offer 
On HW without any REGEN 
400 is Impressive nos

Let‚Äôs accept it !!! It‚Äôs a Electric SUV"
For 30L into it 400 is less
Yes anything above 400+ is good to be happy with.
"Nice...... Plus one more thing.... In many range test videos that we saw today, most of them would include high acceleration to check 0 to 100 , etc which uses more power... 

Even we will try all this initially, but then stick to our regular drive.... So my point is that the real world range with normal drive will be much more than 400 km."
"75000(75kwh battery )/147(kwh per km in instrumental cluster 
)=510 which looks accurate for me"
500 is impressive
He hasn't put the range video yet?
""
I heard from Bangalore showrooms that at the end of this month the first delivery will start. With that we would get more clarity
I agree with that. Always wait and look for all reviews/test drives and then book.
"I feel better to wait for atleast 3-4 months to get the actual range values.
Soon we will have ownership reviews which will be preety acurate."
If that‚Äôs the case then performance will be degraded too right
May b they will tune drive mode as per real world scanarios. To give better range
"May b they will tune torque, power ratio. Probably reduce it. :P"
Listen it !!! I hope it will bring smile üôÇ
""
But very disappointing to hear 400
If we able maintain AEC 160 then it will be 400+ for 65kw
Correct..... Just to add on.... Tata has been mostly right with their C75 claimed range for their other cars... So we can take the C75 range of Harrier EV for consideration....
True... But in my case I will get advantage of MH subsidy and introductory pricing..
Don't know... I booked BE6 3 months back and this thing was discussed in their Telegram group
"Unfortunately, who booked for the first production are Guinea pig to face all these issues ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"My Observations on the Current Harrier EV QWD Range Testing:

From what I understand, the QWD version of the Harrier EV is what's currently being tested and showcased. So far, only a few sensible and controlled range tests have been done. The rest have primarily focused on showcasing terrain handling, ADAS functionality, and high-speed highway capabilities ‚Äî all of which naturally reduce the effective range.

Key Factors Affecting Range:

Climate: Tests done in areas like Faridabad and Agra, where higher temperatures are common, naturally influence battery performance.

Drive Configuration: A rear-wheel-drive (RWD) setup could likely offer an additional 20‚Äì30 km of range under similar conditions, due to better efficiency.

Driving Behavior: Some testers were even driving with the sunroof open for example 

Regen & Speed Patterns:

Highway driving at 80‚Äì90 km/h with regen set to level 1 or 2 and AC usage in the 22‚Äì25¬∞C range (intermittently on/off) will have a predictable impact.

City driving, especially with regen at level 3, helps contribute positively to the combined range.

Current Practical Results: Even after factoring in all the above variables, if the vehicle is delivering a real-world range around 450 km, that seems quite acceptable at this stage.

Expectations Going Forward: Post-launch, with over-the-air (OTA) software updates and optimizations, it wouldn‚Äôt be surprising to see the range improve towards 500 km in mixed driving conditions ‚Äî which would make the offering quite strong. As said earlier Mahindra XEV 9E and BE6 79kw/h batter initially gave around 400 ish kms now few claim they have even got 550 around. Let's wait for rwd reviews"
"How range is lined with software update, will it fine tune with software update?"
Totally agree üëçüèª
This guy got 400
https://youtu.be/GnMSKgoI8R8?si=lr2cvkDKbfRkH-oF
""
"My views after seeing 8 to 10 range test videos on YT...

Will get about 400 km range with battery from 100 to 10%.
City drive will give little more range. 
There will be initial glitches.
There is a lot of power in the car and the built is solid (thats why it's heavy)
The AWD can be used as RWD if the pedal is softly used.

Points to note....

If you see the initial BE6 and XEV9 range test videos, they were also getting around 400km of range and after approx 3 months, with couple of software updates, the range is improved to around 500km...

Yes Harrier is heavy and battery is 4 KW smaller to Mahindra twins, so expect a less range of 40 kms...."
He is telling creta EV in between üòÉ
158 wh/km ? Looks good.
"Tata should have allowed review for both RWD and QWD. Most of the buyers will be going for RWD and by seeing the range in QWD many will drop.
One thing I found out is , in fearless variant the interior will be black as i didn't liked the interior of this top variant. 
I will make my decision after seeing the Fearless varient and my planned test drive of Xev 9e"
This guy got 460
https://youtu.be/OcnSTUEZMW4?si=iqoC9y53meF0k2ybp
This is not harrier ev . No sun roof which is there in qwd
RWD will not have the front motor setup which might increase the range to 25 kms+ still it will be 400 to 425.  With a full loaded vehicle it might even reduce.
On hold will wait RWD range
Waiting for RWD review with expectations
I m still IN. Made my mind for 400. Anything below will be deal breaker for me.
""
Exactly and in that cycle harrier is giving just 360 for top model
"I am switching to XEV 9E, because range is everything for an EV"
We should see 10% to 100 % that‚Äôs the SOC cycle.. but reviews seems to be getting less than 400 km in harrier ev .. it‚Äôs not justified
"500 to 550 xev 9e is giving actual users. , even these youtubers  got 500 kms on it , who are getting 400 on harrier"
Any idea how much does BE6 79kw give in actual?
"It's doesn't justify the amount u invest, for 75 u should expect 500+ range when ARAI says 627 kms"
Kay ka VFM ?
Fearless 75 is best value for money in Harrier
One big factor is that Tata Harrier is heavy so that reflects in range. If we drive it with full family and luggage with AC definitely range will be very less.
"even power to weight ratio of nexon is same as harrier ev for 65kwh variant. nexon ev is 0.075 and harrier is 0.076. So performance is also same , harrier EV personally disappointing to me , was really exicted for it, even booked it before 2 july directly from showroom"

"cancelling my adventure s booking, if 75 gives 400 km , then 65 will give 350, not gonna waste 23 lakhs for it. Better to go for nexon 45 that gives same range , convenient to drive in city and saves 8 lakhs right away, cost of running also low."
"I am ok to proceed if 65 kw gives 400 range. Keeping 1st choice of nexon 45 +  with major upgrades to bigger SUV , almost 2X curb weight. As Harrier"
"Tata setting 600+ ARAI raised our range expectations. 

ARAI - 200 gap is not acceptable"
Front motor does not have Regen
Yes lets wait for RWD since AWD is not properly optimised that‚Äôs clear.
"But when we were ok with nexon for 360-400 range. Why we are thinking for 75 Kw. ? 
If 65 Kw Harrier gives same range as Nexon 45. We should be good to go."
Looks like we have to go for 75 Kwh RWD varient.
I m more curious for RWD range test. I believe QWD eats more battery.
"Any range review for RWD?

Everyone is reviewing QWD"
Looking at all those new reviews I'm rethinking whether I need to go for EV itself. Lots of features but if we use it range gets reduced then what is the use of it. Initial charger setup to solar  setup still if it gives low range that bad. I'm looking at a few hybrids now.
Lots of confusion now.. and it's now getting tough to decide whether we can go with harrier or wait..
We need to see range test for RWD variant
now it make sense as all other are using cruise control when doing range test
As per him whenever adaptive cruise control is enabled vehicle is using both motors so less range .
https://youtu.be/gTvWZ84v-mE?si=DSsRnMjq01RQJACk
"As per T-BHP, suspension of Harrier EV is better than XEV 9E"
"From what I could make from all range videos 
Highway cruising @ 100 - 110 kmph : Range of 430 - 450 
City driving : range 460 - 500

Which is good 
Also looked at DDS, after range test when he was driving on highway at 104kmph, efficiency was 123.6 wh/km
Which is very efficient"
"When looking for Tata review's, I will always move away from Gagan, Faisal and auto yogi 

There are so many media drive invitees, nobody will find any issue nothing in vehicle also

But then these three will always will find ways and somehow only thier vehicles will have problems"
In that case better to buy a larger Safari?
Same as dirsel
And running cost will be 4-5 rupees per km
Very disappointed with range ....because vehical is large and everyone use it for family and highway drive .....if you run 2.5-3 hour at 120-130km/h ....than you need minimum 1 hour break ...
If it‚Äôs done pure off road it will give very less range‚Ä¶
Now having double thoughts after watching all the range tests and issues
now I am not able to convince myself spending 31.5 lacs in having all these issues and range üò¨
"so this test is more practical since in highway generally drive speed is 90,100 and 110"
"Points from this Vedio
Pros :
Good ride quality 
Good tech features 
Solid and rugged exterior 

Cons :
Infotainment screen turns off abruptly..ü§î
Range gives city 380 to 420 
Highway 350 to 380 for Awd Version
Body roll present does not give confidence while overtake.."
thats even disappointing range from other reviews. i guess 400 is the overall common figure of range out of all these reviews for 75kwh
Got an invite for the qwd drive
Range test

3. Tortoise mode activated at 10% SoC speed restricted to 78 kmph

5. 389 at 5% AC got off
6. 415 km SOC left 1%"
"no dont even consider them, see there reviews in US and other places. there wont be any service support , if you want to go with EVs go for tata or mahindra, dont even think other brands"
Chennai Price
"One of concern with Vinfast is, they are coupe models and may not do great on Indian roads , otherwise we can definitely consider waiting for its price and launch"
And also just a note for any of you need to try boost mode SOC should be above 35% keep in mind about this before you go for drive to test this

"This product has been in R&D for ages now !!!!

Tata to ensure when its live 

Its 100% 

That‚Äôs my view"
But
Agree
"At this point lot of pressure on them so many queries we have to do test on our one

When I drive RWD i was shocked it was not at all performing not even close to Nexon late I only discovered ADAS limited speed due to speed sign board

After I disable it and set for audio and visual warning then it showed it‚Äôs power"
You expect that ?
SA should have told me when I asked him regarding steering ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Ya for sure there is so many features I did not explore the other day when I did test drive it was little tired day for me and lot of calls for SA as it was day 1 will try very soon for long drive I can explore lot of its features

The drive quality is very good and the suspension was ok but not great. In large speed breakers the vehicle floor was getting hit. Even I saw the same in review videos . It‚Äôs a major concerns and not accepted from Harrier.Seeing the road condition of Bengaluru i am bit worried.
The other observation is the interior colour combination hence feel dark variant will be good."
Pls share us with the impressions it will be helpful.
"I was pretty impressed with understanding of Suzuki for Indian market. Was thinking for EVitara as Vitara ICE is most luxurious looking car.

Don't worry.. C75 ranges are accurate .  Test drive vehicles are used in a very rough manner with frequent sports mode and boost mode. You will get 450 to 500 minimum in qwd models and some 30 40 kms less in awd models

Curvv is giving 400 at 55 kWh let‚Äôs wait for clear range tests from others. I believe it will give 450-500
this guy did the test in city only
qwd stays in rwd only majority of times unless we push boost mode or really accelerate like pedal to metal
"He drove qwd so around 420 ish. If it's rwd another 30,40 extra and with mix of city regen another 20,30 extra and turn off the ac another 20,30. So 500 plus is sure is wat I am expecting. Correct me if wrong."
But normal users are getting in the ballpark of 500
This guy got 323
I feel like we may wait for VF7 and take a decision based on its price
Same thing happened with Mahindra EVs. No reviewer was getting more than 400 range.
Better to look for CITY range tests than HW for clarity
"i am stating for the video above, not in general"
"Again 

This test is MIX of HW and CITY with speed Avg of 80+ 

Standing at 400+ is outstanding"
Let‚Äôs see all other reviews to come out anything less than 450 range is not acceptable at this price for me üò•
Range is more in city than in highways
"here is the city run, range was infact poor in city than highway. and in city you dont need range anways, as there are ample chargers all aroud. Real range is needed on highways only.
I am personally very disappointed with range, not sating for others"
with regen we should expect at least 500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz-bOjvGXUM
I‚Äôm Confident for CITy range of 450+ for QWD
Hardly there was any REGEN !!
"one guy did it in noida, delhi gurgaon, he also got around 380"
"Did u notice something ? 

These test were conducted on Delhi - Mumbai Xpressway with a constant speed of 80+ !!! 

What u think in CITY it should be at ?"
"We can take it from outside. Static, exicom, zevpoint. Which ever suits"
"only when accelerating super hard, or boost mode or some other mode its goes into qwd , normal driving it stays in rwd"
"drove qwd, but qwd stays in rwd mode during normal drivings, can be seen on display as well"

Yet to see the complete video

QWD or RWD ?"

honestly considering cancelling now
"so if we take 10% as buffer as tata says dont take below 10% , actual real world range between charges is 360km for 75kwh variant. Thats really disappointing, i have booked 65, so that will give around 320 kms,"
at a premium price it feels disappointing.
at 10 percent means Tata has kept no buffer?
"75 variant giving 400 km real world, and once agan tata has kept the tortoise mode after 10 percent,"
"range tests are out, must say very disappointed with range"
I noticed this when I visited showroom and executive was clueless
"Yesterday I took test drive, cluster shows 238 range for 68% battery remaining, and AEC @ 240wh/km which is very high, I asked the executive and he says it‚Äôs on test drives from morning, not sure the real range, I doubt C75 may not be realistic"

"Tata ACFC is Charged and added to X showroom - addition of 49K 

Should we look at static ? 

It has good reviews across"
üëç
They will update the booking to without ACFC model
Or updated
So the previous booking will be cancelled ?
""
I heard Tata provided static itself is around 35K only but not sure why they are charging 50K
"No, charger is mapped against your VIN number and same also reflects on your RC document 
If you want without charger, new allocation will be made
So you can ask him to change your Booking to without ACFC model"
"So what is the best alternative , in the market"
"Or even tomorrow, that u don't want it."
If u have booked with initial booking amount. I think u can very well tell ur dealer when allotment happens
"I already booked with ACFC , as I didn‚Äôt know earlier , can I refuse ACFC at the time of delivery"
"All charging details are getting recorded on OBD. If the charging parameters are maintained, it dosent matter which charger you are using."
"In conditions apply under the battery warranty, if it's mentioned, that we have to use only acfc which tata provides, else warranty won't get applied, then I can accept. They themselves are using external charger only. So yeah go for it bro."
Got it broüëç
""
Ok üëç
"Thats a whole different story. 3dcs followed by a ac. But we can buy our choice acfc, no one can stop it."
Sir what‚Äôs your impression‚Äôs ?
Brother it's our own money and choice. So go for it.
"He said only 3 times a month you can charge on DC charger , not everyday"
"I clearly told them, I won't buy acfc, I won't buy insurance, I won't buy essential pack just the car and some govt charges. Few of the dealers whom I approached accepted to it."
"I really loved the power and suspension , super smooth and sound system was too good"
"We can buy the same acfc which they are providing from outside too, the static one. As tata itself is not producing it right. Also are we gonna use only tata dc chargers everywhere, if so it makes sense. But we use random dc chargers whr ever we go, then the warranty?"
Your thought on QWD after driving
"RWD is not there for testdrive , I asked them to provide one"
Honestly every who has done test drive for more than 30 min let me know what was your thoughts after driving either of variant QWD or RWD
so according to dealer we shouldn‚Äôt charge harrier EV with ACFC which is not sold by Tata ?
Dealer was warning me about the warranty issues in the future
Not at all
""
Is ACFC necessary to buy from Tata Only
"I have Honda City ICE. But don't think I should keep 2 cars. As my run is just 12-15 K kms per year. 
1-2 K kms per month. 

I am just upgrading for fun to drive. I keep changing cars every 3-4 years. I am sort of Enthusiastic Technology loving persons.

Main reason for this upgrade is efficient SUV need for comfort and FE. I m 6.2 feet"
Is it going to be your primary car?
"As per my theorotical calculations, it's just 50 odd kms extra."
"If it's just 40-50 km difference between 65 and 75. 
I don't feel it's worth to pay 3+ lks extra. 

Will go ahead with adventure S 65 booking"
Let's wait for range test
"No experience of XUV 700 so cant compare but I agree with you that opinion of family members is more authentic and unbiased. I have not yet had my family sit in the car but definitely will ask for their opinion. I had Mitsubishi outlander in the past whose cabin was way more luxurious even 13 years ago. 

Rest Harrier seems ticking all boxes"
Even I took test drive.. I think its ok for me it looks premium with that ambient light so called mood light feels good with that but it is better than maruti suzuki cars ...
"Nope
I own XUV 700

the choice of material is better in Harrier EV vs my car
Also have booked XEV 9E Pack 3, XEV 9E feels good only because of three screens 

My wife and mother sat in both, said 9E feels just same as my 700 except for the triple screen layout 

They then went on to see Harrier & Safari, first thing they said was Tata has better cabin material 

And I will always take their opinion more seriously and authentically as we man might be influenced by our likings but they both just tell what they felt"
"I took Harrier test drive yesterday. I felt that use of hard plastic in cabin is excessive. I mean cabin looks quite plasticky. Though cabin has many feel good and defining elements especially central console but all around it looks plastic more. I think at this price, car should have more luxury feeling

Did others also feel the same"
Ya true
Even I thought of buying in Chennai as I have my home thr and proofs. But buying in Chennai and driving in Bangalore is always a trouble and head ache
"I am fine, compromising 6L for these good to be features. But still can live without it."
In chennai no road tax for ev so I'm going for that
Now it's fine but in 5 years? Getting a variant with latest update is good for future right?
More over with a amnt of road quality in Bangalore. I really don't wanna pay road tax
Cos of road tax. In Bangalore any ev below 25L doesn't have road tax. If empower I have to pay 6L extra with variant price difference and road tax. I am fine if I don't have self park and adas so only fearless 75
"If you go for QWD there will be around 5% difference and if you go for RWD there will be 10% range difference 

65 can give around 400
75 Rwd can give around 450
75 awd can give around 425

At speed of 90-100 kmph on highway

Rest all things matters on acceleration , inclination/declination , load  , ambient temp

At 1 lac difference one should go for 75 kWh battery pack as after 8-10 years of degradation it will still give more range then 65kwh pack"
"well thats a shocker, how is mahindra doing it , or harrier EV modes really badly caliberated?
not on any side of brands, as i have booked both xev 9e pack 1 and harrier adventure S, and will pick when reviews are out for both variants"
https://www.youtube.com/shorts/myZV7wHbzvU
"yeah in fearless definitely go for 75, but like i have booked adventure S, and dont plan to go for 75, as range wise its not that big a difference"
Why fearless but not empowered can u share any points?
Still 75 is bigger than 65 with a 1L difference it's safer and better to opt for 75. Totally upto individuals.
"i think between 65 and 75, there will be difference of around 40 kms at max."
Same
Pretty sure 80to100kms difference will be. 65 I think somewhere around 400 and 75 around 500ish. Better to go for 75. I am planning for 75 fearless plus

"Check again 
Turn on the AC and keep it idle
My Nexon EV consumes ~ 1% per hour"
Idleing consumes almost zero. As motor cuts off. It's not like ICE
"Harrier EV definately have big battery. But also the high weight to carry. 

So I am really worried about my 65 Kw booking. 
I m more curious to check the 75 Kw range difference. 
Else need to take a call to spend 3-4 L more, To get 75 Kw varient. 

For 65 Kw , below 400 range will not be acceptable for me . Anything above 400 is ok to go ahead."
"The AEC was 321Wh/km after the drive.
Normally it stays around 130 from what I‚Äôve seen in nexon ev and punch ev."
"Considering this will be doing lot of idling by customers and test drives, everyone doing 0-100, sharp acceleration, boost mode etc. this is a very good range"
"Yes
Drive was really good
The car feels really big."
It's good considering it's a test drive vehicle

"Dealer is looting you, I am from Gujarat too. Just add 90k on any model as insurance+ rto that's it. Tcs u can get back"
What are accessories said will provide?
If anyone from Bangalore looking for fearless + 75 I would suggest to buy without ACFC as is it would cross 25 lakhs so road tax would be applicable its better to take charger outside from exicom  spin 7.2kw charger it would costs Rs. 35k or zevpoint portable charger 7.2 Aero costs Rs.22k . If bought in Tata 7.2 kw costs 75k separately without car ( exicom is the charger supplier for Tata )
Any contact
Get it from pune with BH plate
Insurance and accessories. Official accessories of harrier ev are not out yet

"It is there. 10% or 1 lakh
Whichever is lower"

Cheapest Harrier QWD will be from Odisha /TG / MH / KL
For safety
Its heavy load
"But do add 2 mcb, rcbo and surge protector"
Ok
Any good electrician can do
They will charge too high
U have to install by yourself
What will be approx cost of installation from outside
If u want portable 7kw go with zevpoint
Statiq is a good brand
I would suggest statiq nectar 7kw
Or I can go with other manufacturers also
Now I am asking buy it from tata motors along with car
Then go for 7kw only
Of 7.2 kwh
No I don't have load issue many other chargers already installed in basement parking
If you have load issues they will support it
I understand
You can limit the ampere to slow down
Its app controlled
Yes 7kw charger can slow.down too
No I am talking about 7.2 kWh charger only
Outside chargers can charge at 5kw too
Should we go with charger outside available
"If u OK with timing, its ur choice"
And once in a while charge from 20 to 100 too
Right
Then this time
75 kwh
You buying 75kw or 65?
"If voltage issue, even 15 hours"
50 to 100 will take 12 hours minimum
Who said?
So it will take approximately 8-10 hrs
This time is for 10 to 100 % but I can charge from 40-50% to 100 % twice in a week
Are u ok with 24 hours to 30 hours charging?
3 kw is only when there is no option.
Then its fine
And my running is around 130 km thrice a week
But I have basement parking
Above that its headache
Upto 50kw i can say 3kw is fine
even I am saying we can‚Äôt rely on 3.3 kw for regular charging
If charger heats up it drops from 2.6kw to 1.8kw speed
But charger doesnt have
Correct
Vehicle Has thermal management
No issue in car
No issue. Unless you have open parking then charger might heat
"3kw only charges at 2.6kw. If there is voltage issue it can even drop till 1.8kw.

Now calculate time."
For one complete day and one complete night still it might not get 100%
Its that slow
My only concern is 3kw will make ur head roll
Is there any heating problem or other issue if I charged for 24 hrs continuously on the weekend
"What's the problem if we charge daily 60-70% to 100%

It will charge overnight"
"We have go big time on the electricity company, for example in Bengaluru bescom. We need to pay the hefty to get this done."
Ok
"My plan is to go with 3.3 kW only, without increasing the sanction load and install solar 3KW panels."
Try to get till 6kw
No we can control charging speed
So even if we use 7.2 KW it is only 5 KW charging right? So charging time will increase right?
Mostly we will get only 4KW in home meter i think?
Statiq or zevpoint 7kw can charge at 5kw speed too
Like this
Also to install 7 2 kw you need extra installation and charges to get sanction load increased
3.3 will be too slow for 75 kWh battery you will get frustrated you can ask your society to contact vendors they will come and install
As I don't have a 7.2kw in my society I have to go looking for one near by. Untill i figure out install a permanent charger in my parking lot
Just checking my society has 3.2KW electricic pe set up only.  Can I use that charge for 10 hrs one day turn it off and charge another 10 next day until it becomes 100%?
No you cannot charge it might take 28 hrs for full charge and as per battery norms we need to charge 100% always so 7.2 will be good for you
"Can I charge daily 70% to 100% daily from 3.3 kWh charger

One more question should we buy charger with car or I can buy from outside because tata is charging 49k for this 7.2 kWh charger but outside chargers are available in less than half price"
Me too buying the same variant and my avg driving will be less so I'm going for 3.3KW. but for your usage u might need 7.2 definitely
"3.3 KW will take 30 hrs to full charge 

7.2 will take 13 hrs"
"I am going to buy a tata harrier ev empowered 75 RWD.

I want to know whether I should buy 7.2 kWh charger from tata or 3.3 kWh charger is sufficient as my running is around 130 km per day max ... please suggest"

Both tried XEV 9E & Harrier EV

Neither is too good

Only for minor thing I wouldn't end up paying more. Fine with Harrier ev. Some adjustments we have to do. No choice.
"its good if rear seat passenger height is around 5.5 to 5.9, i am 5,11, so i felt underthigh support could have been better."

"My honest suggestion, I initially planned Adventure S but then I upgraded to Fearless 65 considering 360 camera for such a tank comes in hand most of the times while parking and I didn‚Äôt feel  1 lakh justifies the 40-50kms extra range for 75. Just my opinion. So if budget isn‚Äôt a constraint you can plan for Fearless +"
"What is the process to take insurance from Acko?
We take the car without insurance and get the it later?

Or we can take the insurance before?"
This is myth
@Orangeisbetterthanapple for me it‚Äôs coming around 25.2 with ACFC
Can you give the breakdown ?
Too high
"So I happen to speak to one of the SA here on Boost mode 

Here what he said 

1. The SUV will start with RWD and will detect automatically basis the throttle input for QWD activation, Unless selected manually drive modes. 


2. Boost mode once pressed - will activate QWD , and it will be active untill we switch off or press back again. 


Kindly recheck at your end - Do share the feedback"
Most likely
Reviews will be out on 20th I guess
450-500 üìù
"I‚Äôm expecting 

QWD City - 450/470
RWD City -  480/510"
Eagerly waiting on range reviews
"That is totally subjective.
Here‚Äôs a list of additional features for reference."
Anyway in future lots of ev are gonna come with more range that's for sure
"Yes....our car is not always charged 100 percent 
If we need to start with 50 percent then that 70-80 km will matter lot"
Company should invest in installing flexible solar panel on roof. That will surely work extending the range.
If 75kw would be in adventure S for 1 lakh extra coat then that would be better deal .
"Must have is not harrier infact , the same thing is suffice by nexon üòÅüòÅ"
"But no doubt if someone is looking for adv s 65 
Stretch to 75 fearless for no regret in future"
Also the curb weight should b less ending up in higher range. Less Kw/km consumption
In that a lot features? Any must have useful feature ?
"Exactly , I started with nexon 45 ,mid variaint 15-16 lk approx , reached to windsor pro 20lk , to harrier adv s 65kw 24lk to fearless 75 27lküòêüòê"
65kw battery has one advantage. It will take comparatively less time to charge.
I started with the plan to buy top end Nexon at 15 lk with state subcidy. But looks like it's landing me by paying cost of 2 nexons. üòÇüòÇ
"If u have range anxiety then go for 75kw, else u can choose 65kw"
As you know battery degradation is very common it will reach to 80% in 8 or 9 years in some cases little early so if you have that 10kwh extra at least you don‚Äôt have to worry to much about it as this will balance to some extent otherwise change a battery for that 50 to 100 km it will cost you very high
If you are comparing adv 65 with fearless 75... it's not just the battery it has lot of additional features too
Consider the fact that the actual battery available for use is nett 80%üîã
3+ lakhs is not just for range. There‚Äôs a lot of features that will come along
But 3+ Lakhs is big amount to invest. In that u can have 5Kw solar power plant and use free energy for 25 years. Car + homes uses.
""
"Yes, it's worth to have a big battery. Because you don't use full 0-100 of the battery 

We use 80% only"
"According to me, it is always better to invest in range in case of EV"
"I am confused between 65kw and 75Kw. 

Is it worth to spend 1 Lk more for just 50-60 km extra range ?? + 2 Lk fearless varient upgrade . 
Total 3 lakh extra than Adventure 65 S model ."
"Then you can go for xev 9e if you willing to spend more, compromise on power and have no problem with driving a much bigger vehicle."
Good
"And say no to insurance from showroom and check acko or policy bazar, u ll save another 1L around."
"In Odisha RTO cost is 1650 for all the varients and on top of that you can apply state subsidy which is around 1,50,000."

This wont come if you buy ACFC car

Oops moment
I am getting this quote for fearless 75 ACFC in Noida.
It is recommended to adapt with new tech as it evolves
"I was about to crash the test drive vehicle , as I was unaware of the power"
"With Indian sense of traffic , its difficult to rely on technology"
only feature I like in adas is adaptive cruise control
"There have been multiple instances where the car has applied emergency brakes even when no obstacle was present.
Not just TATA cars. Even volvo."
"No , for fearless 65 with acfc"
I don‚Äôt feel auto parking or summon mode as much usable features
Only reason I am not going with fearless 75 is missing adas I feel adas is really needed if you travel in highway or expressway
Including insurance?
It‚Äôs not required at all
Adas in top model only
But missing ADAS features
+1
In long run yes
True
Is more value for money
I think fearless 75
This is for Fearless 75 right?
27.5 for fearless 75 with acfc
I got 26.60 on road with fast charger
What's the quote anyone got ?pls share

But for 1lakh around 50KM gain average
Yes
I guess people for long term will opt for 75
I booked that as well
"Exactly, that‚Äôs what the test drives guy even told me, he added that front motor engages in sport and boost mode. Not sure though."
like when boost mode is active or off road assist is enabled
I believe we did a test drive in the city with eco mode is RWD only since the front motor does not engage all the time and engage based on driving conditions
I had made a advance booking on 23 of last month and today I had a test drive and booking  confirmed with fearless +75
"I would probably buy qwd since diff is of 1.5l and it would be my purchase for long term.

I am not thinking for off roading but usually travel villages where no proper road‚Ä¶ those road are used by trackters are very bad conditioned‚Ä¶ might help me there‚Ä¶"
I am getting Fearless 75
It‚Äôs a head turner in traffic ü§©
They generally offer top end test drives to attract customers
I guess RWD test drives are not available?
I am buying RWD
"and yeah one more observation, city mode is so underrated"
Is no one going to buy RWD?
"I just took test drives of qwd 75, as [AKS](tg://user?id=963148887) said eco mode alone is enough, sports mode is spot on and you get dragged back, didn‚Äôt engage boost mode as soc is below 50%"
"This is false, ACKO has tie ups with all the service centres of all the brands."
"took test drive of harrier QWD today. 
suspension is very good , car feels very sturdy and tightly put together. Power is too good even in eco mode, i think ECO mode is the only mode that you need. Handling is good, feels in control even with all this power. 

Didnt like AC vents on the pillars, they should have offered blower control for rear seats, thats a big miss in India. 
cabin is not airy when compared to XEV 9E. Boot space is also less in comparison to xev 9e, not just in litres, but visually its less efficiently managed in harrier."

"How much is the showroom asking for insurance?
Is the battery add on included?"
I am driving 2018 honda city and I have  zero dep both acko and bajaj Allianz offered me
"Hopefully they ll give nil dep till 10 yrs, I‚Äôm assuming"
That depends on time to time I believe
Not sure Shiva
till how many years can it be nil dip
ok Can you pls check with acko if nots a problem
"I‚Äôm driving ecosport for last 7.5 yrs and dealers gave me nil dip till 6 years only and this year I took nil dip from ACKO, only ACKO giving me nil dip and no other provider AFAIK"
it will be risky is what i feel
and not zero dep
as it will be comprehensive
no coverage will be there
its not only acko even for dealer insurance its the same
post 5 yrs what will happen to batter cover
i only have one doubt
Sharing it again here FYR
I already shared a screenshot of what ACKO replied earlier on the same context
"Agree these dealers unnecessarily try to confuse us, Acko is good you just need to be aware that all the tick boxes are selected"
"Don‚Äôt create unnecessary confusion in the group if you are not fully aware, they don‚Äôt have tied dealers as such and they ll by default reimburse every Tata showroom PAN India"
If u go for acko if anything happens to your your car dealer will not responsible for this you and your acko need to coordinate
61k for emp qwd stealth from ACKO
"how is the claim settlement etc of ACKO?

Don‚Äôt have any idea about that"
Acko you can get around 45k...so better to go with them
"90K 
But haven‚Äôt done any negotiations yet. Will finalise it on weekend."
How much your dealer is quoting for insurance ?
Check this out
here many people has decided to take from ACKO since it is covering battery as week no separate battery over is required.
"I need some help in making a decision. My dealer is suggesting me to not take the battery cover in insurance. According to him, It‚Äôll save approx 20K in the insurance premium and the battery is very securely packed in multiple layers, so it‚Äôs really hard to damage it."

"ICE

Common routine maintenance tasks, often every 5,000‚Äì15,000 miles or 6‚Äì12 months, include:
‚Ä¢  Oil changes and oil filter replacements (e.g., every 7,500 miles).
‚Ä¢  Spark plug replacements.
‚Ä¢  Air filter and fuel filter changes.
‚Ä¢  Coolant flushes and thermostat checks.
‚Ä¢  Transmission fluid changes.
‚Ä¢  Brake fluid replacement.
‚Ä¢  Fuel system inspections and fuel injector cleaning.
‚Ä¢  Emissions system checks (e.g., O2 sensors, catalytic converters).
‚Ä¢  Timing belt and accessory drive belt inspections.
‚Ä¢  Brake pads, rotors (regular wear from friction braking).
‚Ä¢  Tire rotations and replacement.
‚Ä¢  Cabin air filter replacement.
‚Ä¢  Wiper blade replacement.
‚Ä¢  Washer fluid top-up.
‚Ä¢  Suspension and steering components inspection (e.g., shocks, struts).

EV

EVs have fewer items, often with longer intervals (e.g., every 7,500 miles for basics or every 2‚Äì5 years for others), focusing on electrical and mechanical systems:
‚Ä¢  Tire rotations (e.g., every 7,500 miles; more frequent due to vehicle weight and torque).
‚Ä¢  Cabin air filter replacement (e.g., every 2‚Äì3 years or 22,500 miles).
‚Ä¢  Brake fluid replacement (e.g., every 5 years).
‚Ä¢  Coolant circuit drain and fill for battery thermal management (e.g., every 5 years or 150,000 miles).
‚Ä¢  Battery health monitoring and inspections; potential replacement (rare within warranty).
‚Ä¢  Electric motor and inverter inspections.
‚Ä¢  Brake system checks (less frequent due to regenerative braking, extending pad life).
‚Ä¢  Wiper blade replacement.
‚Ä¢  Washer fluid top-up.
‚Ä¢  Suspension and steering components inspection.
‚Ä¢  A/C desiccant replacement (e.g., every 7 years).
‚Ä¢  Software updates (often over-the-air, no shop visit needed).
‚Ä¢  Charging system inspection (e.g., home charger if applicable).
‚Ä¢  Electric drive unit fluid replacement (e.g., every 10 years or 150,000 miles).
‚Ä¢  Hood and hatch support struts (e.g., every 10 years or 100,000 miles)."
ICE is totally different so many parts lubrications filters oil etc
because in ICE vehicles they are charging good money even in 6 months checkups as well
i hope they dont make this 6 months service cycle mandatory for battery warranty to be valid.
Congratulations to all - I asked Perplexity Pro AI & it‚Äôs seems true

it seems jump n all is extra ordinary use.
""
"The term ‚Äúextra-ordinary use‚Äù in this context refers to usage of the vehicle that goes beyond what is considered normal or reasonable for personal use. This includes activities or conditions that deviate from the typical expectations for a vehicle not used for commercial or trade purposes, such as excessive wear and tear due to heavy-duty tasks, misuse, or operating the vehicle in ways that significantly exceed standard personal usage (e.g., frequent overloading, extreme driving conditions, or non-personal activities like taxi services). The ‚Äúlifetime‚Äù warranty assumes fair personal use, and extraordinary use outside this norm would void or limit the warranty coverage. - grok"
"May be this is for people who drive few lacs kms in a year or something like that. Because ordinary use may be something like 15k to 50k in a year. Just assuming. 
But an important point to note is the unlimited warranty is not available for registrations in the name of companies."
"I fail to understand line 3 states extra ordinary use - Excludes the warranty 

So all the jump in the air shown in qwad drive ?"

He said white
Oxcide and grey are too close
Even with maintenance in mknd am leaning towards grey
It's better to check with the service guy the might say that it is oxide üòä
Today i saw white at Bachupally branch
True that
In this video he says this is white color but still i feel grey or oxide
https://youtu.be/wx5CWcBj-rM?si=bSarlblvOD9iEoiy
""
This is oxide as told by SA
"Blue only has dual tone right blue with pink, you mean grey n black"
Dark colours look better irl
"Pics
We got grey at our place"
my personal opinion dual tone looks best in pure grey.
You saw blue personally? Or only in pics
Already ?? Super then
"Long run 
Light colours might look better with less maintainence 

However if it was mine
I personally like stealth and blue"
I'm getting ertiga vibe while looking at blue
I doubt in the long run blue won't look good
This is pure grey
"I guess each colour has its own charm
Especially the Blue and grey

I would recommend personally checking out"
""
Yes
"pure grey, oxide and white are all too confusing, especially in pictures"
Must b white
looks like pure grey
This is white color or oxicide?
Both differ by 1 lakh
Will be 40-50 kms difference hopefully
Almost 1 ton difference
I believe I can touch 500 on good road. By my driving style
65 or 75
"I expect 400+ range. 

Plz note nexon 45 with lightweight less pickup is almost equal to harrier with more power , torque at 65 kw. 

So range should be 400-450 kms. Below 500 
Keep ur expectations low. To be more happy"

Test drive at jasper narsingi
I have seen ppl reporting they were getting 650 an all in xev9e in mahindra grp. So it totally depends on how we drive and conditions. My personal opinion. I am expecting 450 to 500 avg and more if driven decent
"if it gives no nonsense range of 400 km then its great, by no nonsense i mean from 90% to 10% discharge. as thats what actually matters. below 10% company says dont take it, and above 90% even DC chargers takes super long time."
for personal driving we should more than 450 minimum
Rear comfort?
it may be different people driving and trying different modes like boost and other modes if this is the case then 400 is good
Jasper motors Narsingi test drives from tomorrow
It was impressive
how are driving dynamics and ultra glide suspension?
Despite of interiors being very much light i guess battery tech and chassis are heavier
then only we will know
"not good at all , if thats the real mileage, lets see, let the youtubers do range test next week"
He also said that it will increase
Quite low
QWD 75
"well thats too low for 75, what will 65 give then, 350 ?"
400 for? 65 ?
when I did test drive I asked how much range is it given right now he said 400
"Even Mahindra RWD with 79kWh gives only max 500, that too in city only. Check their brochure & advertisement - they clearly mention CITY RANGE : 500km
That is why people who use it on Highway also get less than 500km range

Tata's C75 is more credible, it shows mix of city + highway
And Tata is saying 480 - 505km

So I would trust Tata more, plus people are able to achieve C75 numbers easily"
"yes they have told, but worry is xev9e is lighter by almost 150 kgs than harrier, and has a bigger battery , and less power , and yet gives only around 450 to 500 km in real world. So will harrier EV achieve more than that with more power, more weight, less battery?"
Else maybe 550-600 RWD
I guess it's the heaviest in its segment?
I was expecting 500 for C75
"It's Black Matt
Matt is just the finish
Base color is BLACK only"
"How much range are you worried for?
Tata has already given real world range numbers (C75)
RWD : 480 - 505
QWD : 460 - 490"
No
I will get on the 20th
You got allotment ?
On 20th July
It does requires frequent maintenance
"Gloss is basically polished kind,
We have matt variant only for Black right?"
"Matt is texture
Not colour"
""
"It‚Äôs Matt. And not black. 

ICE harrier on both these shades looks different"
Yes but scratches won't be as visible
Stealth edition
Else your heart will pain every month
We don‚Äôt have black
Buy a black car only if u dont care about scratches
Matte is only in black and thats the most difficult to maintain
But black looks much better
"True
I have seen lots of black models already looking old


What about matte models?"
White has many advantages
"Even I feel so 

White and grey are best"
"Even minor scratch will be highly visible, the same scratch in white will not be easily visible"
Bright white... Similar to pearl white of innova
What's the disadvantage with black?
Yes... Nocturne is the blue only
"I recently have a black coloured car and fed up with the Maintainance, so have booked oxide"
I have booked white for now.  Not sure how it looks
How is nocturne color
I booked oxide.... If you ok with dark colours then blue is the best
"Grey looks great 

Esp the harrier . EV badging looks very promising"
Yes ... I m also anxious about the range only......
Which color looks good ?
Yes it is Pure grey
"I have seen all 4 colours together live, so i know this is pure grey..... Oxide looks almost like white"
No it's pure grey....
"I'm waiting for Range reviews
As this is a heavy car,"
"Media Reviews will be out tomo 

Mostly"
Till now no proper review videos are allowed to share
Oxcide sir
Is that white or oxicide?
"Will be getting this hands on tomo 

Will share it as well"
"My few observations 

1. Panel gaps have reduced significantly 

2. Oxicide colour  looks good under sun though it was cloudy today in Bengaluru 

3. Leather seats quality is top notch

When i was asking abt fearless 75 they said 2 weeks from the booking allotment happens and 1 or 2 from then delivery. So total 1 to 1 and half months in total. As they were taking bookings not only from July 2nd but unofficially since early this year. So yeah first set should be top end.
"major issues nahi aate , but chote mote niggles to hamesha first lot cars mein rehate hai"
"sir ji ye to hamesha hota hai, mahindra aur tata dono ke sath. Its sad but its reality"

"thats not bad, considering initial models come with bugs and issues, so better to get a bug free car later , rather than getting first lot and then facing issues and visiting service centres"
"They are saying only topend varient delivery will start. 
Other varients 2-3 months waiting"
First am waiting for team bhp reviews
July 20th first delivery starts as per the showroom in Bangalore
"This month end deliveries are starting , SC confirmed me"

And also for other tata customers who can share their valuable knowledge
Yes I have also booked... I thought this group is exclusively for Harrier EV members only...
we are all in the same boat
How much did it cost u?
Many
"Anyone joined here after Harrier EV launch ? 
Wanted to buy Nexon , but now planning for Harrier? 

I am the only one ? Or anybody else is there ?"
"U can opt for any charger. From tata it will cost 50K or more. Other options are Exicom , ZevPoint .

I opted for Zevpoint portable 7.2 Kw. 
I have 2 homes. Will install only 32A socket at both home. And use 1 fast charger."
Tesla FSD will be costing 6l in India üòÅ
"Nowhere it is mentioned that you should only charge on Tata provided and installed chargers. We charge our cars at different make chargers. It doesn't affect the warranty.  But if anything happens due a short circuit or suchthing, they may not take responsibility. But it's a rare chance."
"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMISfoNhmlY/?igsh=MXdzODR3bnhnbzR5MA==


Not sure if this is true 

Roxx came with the same feature last August"
https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMIES7xB8iF/?igsh=cDZiaWZjeTQzMGNw
That is applicable for all dc chargers then
"Yes I am aware abt that. The wall box installation should we only do with tata provided or can we check else where also? In tat case if anything happens, will it affect 15 yr battery warranty, as they may say, u did not use tata provided charger"
Portable charger comes with all cars. 7.2 kw you can buy from anyone.
"Folks, need a suggestion, should we mandatorily go with tata providing 7.2kwh charger box and portable cable. Or can we buy it from outside later. If suppose we buy from outside and something happens to battery charging, will thr be a catch in life time warranty? Suggestions pls. If no wat is the suggested best wall charger cum portable cable suitable for harrier ev?"
Agree but does terms & conditions says that ?
"Agree with this. Let's avoid DV charges as much as possible, on long trips use upto 90-95 %"
If you think you can abuse your battery as you wish and still get warranty. Good lucküëç
Nothing is without terms and conditions
"There are 2 main reasons for advising not to charge more than 90% on DC fast chargers.
1. It takes much more time to charge from 90 (specially from 95%) to 100% due to cell balancing activity. This will waste your time and more importantly block the charger and inconveniences others wating to charge.
2. There are some chargers (like bpcl) which create hv error while charging to 100%. This error flag can be removed only by towing to nearest service center.
So you can avoid lot time waste by restricting to 90% or max 95% charging on DC."
No
No
Not correct
Did anyone got call from your dealer regarding the allocation of chassis number ?
"Always if possible charge to 100%
Else maybe 1 charge to 100% after 3-4 80% charges

And this is a global practice and direction

Tata has it mentioned in owners manual also

Don't fall for false agendas"
I am not sure when Tata is giving 15 years warranty then why we need to care ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è they make sure that your battery capacity is always > 80% just asking ?
"Saw in other group 
DC charge ap 80 tak ya max 90 tak karo. Dont use it till 100% unless absolutely necessary. 

Abhi farak nhi pta chalega. 
But in long run, when we compare soh of our batteries after 5-6 years, tab farak pata chalega

Is this correct"
"Yes The EV Version too

"To get quote for a new vehicle, chasis number is not required. You can try policy bazar and get quote from multiple companies."
Its good fight for india. Else trump kaka would have pushed tesl on our throats.
"Happened once due to bad road in 2,10,000 km of rural driving for me"
Wanted to get test drive for my wife as she will be primary driver
Lets see
So in a day or 2 test drive and then i will confirm the color
"Thanks Shekar, just today i had a word with Bachupally dealer today or tom car for display is coming"
U can call ACKO and get quote first
"Once vehicle is allotted to you, u ll get VIN & chassis number, u have to share those details with insurance company"
Like i start the insurance conversation without any chasis no ?
Whats the process
"Yeah, it‚Äôs ur basic right to choose ur own insurance"
"Thanks, better to buy directly online"
Is it possible ?
Yes agree but current situation is Trump mama and musk mama has conflict so he wont allow any company to set up plant outside US
"what about this ?

The Indian government has announced a policy that allows for a 15% import duty on electric vehicles (including Tesla) if the company invests a certain amount (around $500 million or Rs 4,150 crore) in establishing a local manufacturing facility within India. This benefit is capped at 8,000 units per year."
I doubt
Without taxes should be 30-40lakhs
Sadly taxes will raise the price to 70lakhs
Lowest was 106075 for empowered 75
My dealers quoted me 1.17 and 1.24 lakhs
"Why buy insurance from dealer, u can get it from acko for 44K or from HDFC Ergo for 48k ,"
How much is your dealer quoting for insurance? In Pune dealer gave me quote of 1.42L for fearless+ 75
"https://www.expwithevs.in/p/corrected-2506-ev-charging-infra/

Is Tesla going to be priced at 30 - 35 lacs ?
Extra ordinary failure they are trying to dump
Isn't VinFast a failure

If u dont want to be part of glitches go with tata. Its less glitchy now
Tata has learned from previous vehicles. Even earlier vehicles of tata had issues. But most of them are sorted now
"No matter you buy 11 kw, 22kw or 40kw. Harrier will charge at 7kw only"

Multiple such issues with XEV 9E
on the Contrast, people were worried about Harrier.ev. 

But it was all proved by Tata during Quad Day that vehicle is flawless. As per T-BHP there were more than 90 cars on track on Quad Day. All given for proper Hardcore Off-roading for full day, track action for full day. And not a single vehicle faced any issue.

This speaks a lot about the vehicle."
""
Can't agree more. But fearless 75 coming under 25L was my deciding factor.
"More than the price, stability and suspension and other issues"
"Yes, I booked 9e 59 pack 2 in April. Cancelled it two days before. When I can buy harrier 75 fearless that too lesser than 9e. Harrier pricing was way good and the features provided."
"Also to cater the demands in initial months few colour options will help manufacturers, so until the hype comes down, they ll plan to introduce more colours"
"That‚Äôs mostly depends on competitors, xev 9e 79kw available only on top variant, now its available in mid variant due to harrier"
Any idea how long it will take? So is it better to wait and book?
"That‚Äôs expected, to attract more customers at a later stage"
Did not get that? If they give all the four colors in all the variants that itself will be great
Am hearing more colors will be in offing
"Wil be driving on a exhaustive terrain and wish to see the drop in energy

"Yep currently he is only dealer giving test drive 

All other dealers are like to get by 15th to 20th"
"Same showroom, I too did yesterday too. Too much crowd and also we were in queue for test drive due to high demand. It was a short test drive still impressive. Need to do in few other showrooms too."

If we have solar will that be beneficial then we dont need to have higher capacity
"Oh i have 4 AC 1 chimney 3 geyser one tv, washing machine and fridge"
Deliveries one month from the day of booking maximum 2 months said by SA
"2 geyser, 1 chimney, 1 AC, 1 induction, led tv  rest depends what appliances you have"
Generally 5 kw of load is recommended if you have 3 bedroom house.
It's depend upon how many AC you have+ other appliance.+ fan+ bulb.... It's not like that u use or not.... Load will calacute on number of appliance
If we install 7.2kWh fast one will 10kl load will be enough?
How do one calculate using it we dont use all appliances all the time
Sorry am new to all these so checking
Okay
Just google.. electricity load calculator
How can i check my existing load
I currently have 3 phase and i want to see what will be my load so that i dont overload
They can replace defective cell
Here its not the case
They didnt chose blade batteries as if there is any issue with one cell they have to replace complete battwry
That's great
They will replace cells if soh < 85% and they check during yrly maintenance

0 Cabin noise if am not exaggerating
No i couldnt feel
Camera quality of the dash is good
It's dual tone color
In nainital
Blue and Pink ?
Are you able to feel the dual tone of the blue and pink?

1. Stealth black
2. Oxide"
Oxide
White or nainital ? Which looks good
With stealth black maintenance will be high
Correct
So this is nainital nocture ?
If u have good setting it can be fast or else it will be late
Delivery date?? Any idea
4 years of IRA subscription at the time of delivery
XEV 9E driving comfort is not so good
I felt like i was driving aeroplane cockpit
Blown away by suspension and power and sound and driving comfort

Leg room at the back is good

"Hi,

I own a Tata Safari Accomplished+ automatic 2024 model.

Yesterday I was crushing on highway, suddenly started seeing errors on my dashboard. Errors such as, TPMS malfunction, LKA malfunction, Hill assist malfunction, etc. I stopped my vehicle on the side and turned it off. After that when I tried to start the vehicle, it didn't start. Called RSA they tried jump starting it, but the vehicle turned off as soon as they removed the secondary battery support. Towed the vehicle to nearest service centre after 10 hour struggling on road. The battery in my car was replaced under warranty 2 weeks back. 

If anyone else faced this issue, please do let me know the solution."

I won't tolerate robbery and misleading falsified commitments.
Buying a grease for 50rs is sufficient to lubricate all callipers + minor parts
No
Can anyone let me know wt this service plus 3m is? My advisor told it's brake caliper grease. Is it true?
Yeah no doubt about it now. Here we have a new outlet Dps and treo is little far in okhla otherwise its better.

I don't have first hand experience in this issue. Just sharing a reference

"Did this, but the problem persist"

"Does yours come with a subwoofer and amp in your variant?
Did you recently have any water accumulation issue in your car ?

These will help pin point the issue to some extent"
I have heard of issues where due to ac drain pipe block water gets accumulated under driver seat and sometimes causes the amplifier to go dead
"Hi everyone 
Harriers speakers are not working, stereo is not giving any sound, suggest any DIY before takes h it to SC"
Thanks Karthikeyan....yes SC replaced it completely in my case
"It's mandatory if fogging.

Please insist of replacement even  if sc denies and tells to switch on the light for 10-15 mins.

I can't able to share existing case studies due to its confidentiality. 

Please make sure there was no damages present. If damage was there replacement under warranty was not possible.

Also make sure to replace or get an acknowledgement if warranty was about to expire in case of fogging."
Agree... For me too within 6 months  of car purchase it had developed moisture ....SC replaced it completely
"No no 

Those are fully sealed.

Moisture shouldn't get inside.

Moisture will capture micron level dust and particles inside doom which makes it dull from inside and also possibilities of short circuit.

Replacement was required if you see moisture inside electronic components."
Moisture will go away by itself.
Why ?it not a big deal
"2700 for parts 
400 for door pad r&r
Another 400 for winder assembly replacement.
+Tax

Correct amount.

The replaced channel will have  warranty. 

You can sell the old winder part in listings.

Not all are same.
I have seen their mentality so I reduced my expectations üòÉ
"Why bro?

What's wrong with tata comparing to bmw.

Service centre should follow time sense and commitment. That's why we are paying them. Tata service policy was stricter than bmw or any other brands. 

If you don't know the process or instructions. Don't comment bro."
"Doesn't matter. 
Customer satisfaction and service should remain the same. Whether you buy a Tata or BMW and Tata's premium cars also come at a premium cost 30 lakhs. 

Its a lot of money, so it's not a problem to expect good service and customer relationship with the clients"
"I am not defending service centre people 

But Your expectations also need to be realistic, in india not all company service centre follow ""time sense"", they will be in ""kar denge"" ""hojayega"" mind set so we need to increase our tolerance we have brought tata vehicle not porsche or BMW"
"I had a disappointing experience with this service center. Two weeks ago, I visited for DEF refueling, which took nearly two hours for a very minor task. Despite this negative first impression, I decided to give them another opportunity by booking my Harrier‚Äôs 90,000 km major service, along with their pick-and-drop facility.

The pickup point was just 3 km away, hardly a 7-minute drive from the service center, and the committed pickup time was 9:30 a.m. However, even after waiting until 10:30 a.m., no one arrived. I had to make multiple follow-up calls, during which I was given the name of one pickup person, then another after 20 minutes, and later even a third. The lack of coordination and delay ultimately led me to cancel the service request.

Based on these repeated inefficiencies, I would strongly suggest that customers carefully reconsider before entrusting their vehicles here. During my first visit as well, I observed several dissatisfied customers expressing frustration, which now seems understandable.

"Hi dear all,

General info

If you are parking the car more than 15 days.

Do not engage parking brakes.

Instead use wheel supports.

Parking brakes --> Put it on gear or P --> Give wheel supports ex. Brick or wooden block ---> Release parking brakes.


While restarting -----> Engage parking brakes --> remove wheel support --> Drive like you asusual


This will reduce the fatigue failure and improve the life of brake system."

This is fine."

"1. Restart ( force) infotainment system 
2. If it completely didn't work, check with SC and replace. 

Both I have personally encountered in harrier, changed free being in warranty period."
"Try force restarting 

Also small precaution: do not engage reverse gear as soon as you start the vehicle, after starting let the infotainment system turn on, give like 30 secs then engage the reverse gear, happens with me when I do that."

"Friends, I am facing an issue with 360 camera in my 2 weeks old safari accomplished plus model. It does not switch on when the button is pressed on dash board. Neither reverse camera works. This happened twice. Earlier, got corrected on its own within 5 mins but yesterday it persisted even after 3-4 start attempts. Can anyone guide on possible cause. I feel it's very risky if that happens in middle of a journey. You are left to judgement only!!"
Yeah I am also thinking like this because of dash camera is taking power from obd nowadays
I am not sure if the warranty would be void as there are lots of obd based accesories available in the market and should not affect the warranty.
"No need of display, but warranty clause I am checking around"
You won't find a TATA authorised tool for it... most of them are 3rd party tools. You will get a cheaper one with limited functionality  for about 2k..but the more advanced ones cost around 20k to 30k with display.
"Use only tata authorised diagnostic tool.

Warranty will void if unauthorised entry log found."

"yes 
I noticed consumables and jokingly told that you guys are behaving like hospitals now

it‚Äôs your responsibility to make sure car seats and other parts are protected during service 
why would you charge extra for that apart from labour üòÖüòÖ"
"Also, they rarley follow the service protocol...they are supposed to make video and share it the wa group for each and every work done plus any consumables used."
Earlier the service centers were transparent with their pricing. Now they try to overcharge wherever possible. Once i got my wipers changed during service...they added extra labour cost for that as well. Next time during service they were charging extra lobour for break pad change. Even DEF which cost 60rs/liter they are selling it for 110 rs and there charge for seprate charge for cloth and something else. During the service they will create a long list of what of additonal unwanted  services.  The major service cost for my car in the last 3 years has gone from 12k to 16k to 20k. For the same service.
"Hi @Everyone in my recent long drive trip completion, I realised crack to windshield at corner. Not sure how it happend as didnt hear any sound. The crack doesn‚Äôt gone into deep where inside surface still smooth only. Pls suggest the options here.

AC vent cleaning

The foam used to clean the vents will have some chemicals

The foam will be directly injected into ac ducts and it will reach cooling coil.

Later the condensed liquid will release via ac drain pipe.

I am not into part whether if it was required or not.

But definitely the aftermath sediments of foam disinfectants will be left in the duct. The disinfectants will also have some sort of corrosive nature.

The AC filter is there to stop and filter the nano level dust and debris before reaching the cooling coil and vents.

Writing this for your knowledge and for future references."
I would say it is above nominal with AMC and brake pad it should have been below 20k..or max 22..

1) Do wheel alignment and tyre rotation if pending .

2) Check direction of rotation of tyres are alligned with wheels direction of movement

3) Check small cracks on wiper blade rubber if present - replace them.

4) Check battery physical indicator in the battery. If need do recharge.

5) Open all doors and check for any stucked items or mis allignments in all door beedings and rubbers.

6) Check coolant level, brake fluid level, engine oil level. If need replace or do top-up.

7) Inflate tyre pressure properly including Stephany wheel.

8) Remove foreign objects like stones on grid and other things from tyre.

9) Check for proper action on both wipers

Thanks much for detailed response. Very helpful
Yes
Is Exide the recommended battery for Harrier?
No wonder the OEM battery is being given with 18 months but if you buy the same Exide battery outside you get 36 months warranty
Faced the same issue and got it Free of Cost replaced at 15 months under warranty. Now it's been another 20 months and no issues.
Costed me around 8.5 k after replacing the old one
"1) Yes 95% faced similar problem.
2) Normal for first battery 3)recharging the battery was instant temporary fix and costly too.
4)No you can buy it from outside. It won't affect the warranty until you are replacing it with same brand and make.
5) Exide recommended but first check which battery outlet and battery service centre was near you.
6) Exide or Amaron but amaron will have opposite side terminals and higher ah rating.

Reconditioning of battery not advisable. New electrolyte on old battery will cause voltage fluctuations and battery spillings"
Got it. Thank You
"Get battery from any exide dealer instead of SC. You won't get 78 ah battery in other brands, no warranty issues. Should cost around 7.5 k woth exchangr"
"Since it was less than a year, it was still under warranty. So it costed me nothing"
Thank you. Would you mind sharing how much it costed ?
Yes. The Exide OEM batteries that come with Harrier/Safari have issues. More so from past few years. I had to get mine replaced within 10 months of purchasing the car as it would not start one morning. Battery tests revealed that the battery is the problem. I was told that the replacement battery should not have such problems. At-least for a couple of years.
Battery replacement is normal for any car
"**Hi everyone, looking for some guidance.**
Just to give you some context ‚Äî I own a **2022 Tata Harrier Kaziranga edition (top-end)**, though the **registration is from Jan 2023**. I‚Äôve driven around **35,000 km** so far without any major issues.

However, **yesterday the car wouldn‚Äôt start**, and when I contacted the service center, they suspected a **battery issue** and said it might need replacement. The service technician mentioned that this is a **common issue in Harrier models**, with battery replacements often required **within 18 to 24 months**.

I‚Äôve never faced any starting trouble until now, so this came as a surprise. He also mentioned the **battery cost would be around ‚Çπ10,000**, but said he would confirm the exact amount.

Would really appreciate any insights from fellow owners. A few specific questions:
 ‚Ä¢ Has anyone else faced a similar battery issue this early with their Harrier?
 ‚Ä¢ Is it normal for Harrier batteries to need replacement in just 18‚Äì24 months?
 ‚Ä¢ Would you recommend trying to **recharge the battery** instead of replacing it?
 ‚Ä¢ If I get the battery recharged or replaced **outside the service center**, would that **affect the vehicle warranty**?
 ‚Ä¢ Any particular **battery brand or type** you‚Äôd recommend if replacement is needed?

Thanks in advance for your help!"

Is it advisable to convert MT to iMT using https://cityclutch.com/ or https://automateindia.in/service/auto-clutch-for-manual-car/ in Harrier? Has any one installed it?

"Where did you get it replaced? I would suggest taking your car to the service center. It could be that the disc rotor is misallinged, not sure.."
Changed disc pads 15-20 days back. They were in perfectly good condition bt changed it anywys to get rid of the sound. The sound is coming from my rear drum brakes. Nt sure whats wrong as my brake pads are also in good condition.
When did you change ur disc brakes? Wornout brakes tend to stick to the discs.
My harrier has rear drum breaks.
Rusting won't make squeaky noise.
Rusting?
"What???

How will abs even work on slow speed??"
"Must be abs issue. This is normal with all disc brakes

Try using stp brake cleaner spray"
Hello everyone. I have a 2022 harrier xz+. From last couple of months my harrier makes sqeaky sound while breaking. Usually happens when the car is in slow speed or while breaking slowly. I already have my rear break pads checked and they are in pretty gud condition. The squeaky sounds starts coming after driving the car for 10-12 km. Any suggestions. Thnx.
"Same with me its more than 10k KM including non stop drive from delhi to Hyd after the alignment is done

The left pulling issue got resolved after i got the balancing and alignment done fro outside

It never got resolved when I complained during service and the service center did the alignment and balancing"
Use websites for generating bills
Just curious do you own either safari or Harrier?
Sorry to hear about service quality.
"At what speed?

When was the problem started?

How many kms was the current odo reading?

What is the date of sale?

Any Non OE equipments used like outside alloy or tyre or wheel spacer or suspension spacer rubbers, etc??

How many times alignment done till now? Can you share all allignment reports to me privately???

Any damage or accidental history?"
Looks like it. My left pulling issue got resolved the moment I did wheel alignment in external wheel shop
Anywhere Between August to october ?
Hi guys is there any planned trip upcomming ?
Their wheel alignment setting in their machine is most of the service centers is off...
It is fixable...raise the complaint with service center...else you can get it done outside..
Why can't they set the offset of some degree while doing wheel alignment if it is not fixable from root.
I heard the same thing from more owners
SAFARI pulling towards left while running. I made complaints multiple times to SC. They performs wheel alignment but again the same issue... Is this the design fault in this car?
"Glow plug issue, you need to change it"
What is this sign for
The owner might also be in this group. To be fair this car was avaialble for 23l (noida) in 2022. In 3 years the value of the car would have depreciated considerably. So my estimate puts it at 15 lacks. Given that facelift is also available...max you could go is 15.5.
Checked Spinny and it suggested Rs.14.5 to Rs.16.5
"Overpriced.

Check with any showroom, they might have 2023 pre facelift xza+ for same price, it has better features"
Definitely
Over priced
"I received this 2022 XZA PLUS KAZIRANGA edition. Done 14,000 kms . Single owner. Owner is asking 21L. Pl let me know if it's a fair price or over priced. I planning to buy this. If you could suggest it will be of great help"

2. Accessory : The accessory cost double at the showroom. The window visor from outside. Side steps.. 18 to 20 k in showroom, 8.5 from outside. 23k electronic folding side steps

Today while driving in Wet mode, I felt the brake was much better and the softness was not there. So I am wondering if this has got something to do with some electronics setting in brake sensors which just needs some mild adjustment for City mode of driving. Did anyone else have this kind of experience or can it be checked? Thanks guys"
Ok

"Safari does have a poor resale value..but it more comfortable than scorpio N. Drive is also smoother. Service for both the cars is expenaive. But you will get a better feel in safari, specially the doors, the door width is compartively more that xuv 700, scorpoi N and Thar roxx, the door width is less and all the cup holder, buttons are protuding out wheras everthing is within the door for safari. It gave me a bolero kind of feel."
"2 very different style suvs ..
Safari - monocoque chassis for comfort ride and luxury styled suv

N Scorpio - ladder on frame chassis gives u that raw suv feel with 4x4 capability 

So depends on the requirement"
And what about its service cost?
Got ur point
"Scorpio N stance is very truck like, too much body roll.
Safari is better.

But it's personal preference, test drive (with family) and decide."
Also let me know about maintenance cost and service issues if any

"This is a wonderful car you will truly enjoy it..tje power, the drive, the music system.. Given that there have been some issues with the quality of the recently. The service centers are overcrowded...the number service centers has grown propostional to the sales. There is lack of proper training to the service personal, so if your lucky the right person will get aasigned to you, otherwise the issue will take a lot of time to get resolved.also you won't be treated as premium car woner at service center, the mannerism would be same aa if you own a nano. You are litrealy at the mercy of service center no matter to which ever level you escalate the issue, it would upto the service center to resolve the issue. I hear mahindra is also same."
"My experience is the best car and service experience. 

But I would highly recommend doing a centre review where you will buy from and do service. Some centres have consistently bad feedback, stay away from them.
Do a third party PDI then only pay.

Prefer auto."
"Who ever I'm asking an opinion about Harrier, everyone says to look for other car because of quality and service issue. Asking this group about your honest opinion. Would you first of all recommend a Harrier. If you do what would you recommend? Pre face lift second hand or facelift."

No its OEM
What is the approx service cost per year with Harrier
Have you changed alloys?
"Go for automatic unless you will drive in uncongested areas... but in India, there is traffic everywhere and going for automatic option in big cars is a better decision in my opinion"
My suggestion would be to go with the version which has the features you are looking for
My beast
Best thing is to take a test drive .
If there is too much traffic then you would be tired . Or else if there is light traffic then manual is good . With time you get use to the hard clutch of car
Manual transmission is not enjoyable in TATA
"Try out, Harrier, Safari clutch is not easy."
"Non oe professionals are doing wreckless things for powering up the non oe equipments 

Causing power problem to existing electronics and computers in the car.

Which are costly to replace in case of mishaps like 30,000 to 98,000 per small unit"

Is Manual Harrier manageable to drive in city bumper to bumper
"Need your suggestion to buy Harrier base variant Smart and do after market upgrade of sound, cruise control, remote locking etc. is it good decision or buy pure variant"
Thanks for the information. Does hard wiring cause any issues with warranty? And did you do the installation on your own?

Hope you got it fixed
What is your Tyre size
"Yes, that was the case...."
"Ohh if green while moving, then get it checked, brake oil issue"
It had turned green while moving....flat or normal surface
It came when I started the engine
Which year model are they calling for this oil change? Mine is 2022 feb one but no intimation from sagar noida on this.
"Eco mode suitable for 2-3 people travel without luggage.

That too check proper tyre inflation.

2-3 people + luggages is only suitable for long drive on eco mode"
I agree bro
I always drive on eco mode only bro.. sports gives the thrill when needed
"It will turn green even after you stop the car and shift to N or R, but it will go when you shift to P when auto hold is disengaged and electronic parking brake gets engaged"
It's not a sensor issue unless and until it turns green while the car is moving
"Did it came when the car was moving and then came to stop?

If yes then the electronic parking brake gets engaged, it's called auto hold feature, if you disable auto hold, the car will keep moving after releasing the brake paddle,
Green means it is engaged. It is a useful feature in bumper to bumper traffic, I used it at all times"
"My experience,
Eco for cruise when flat or slope
City for most use 
Sports is the real game"
Yes you can
"It was coming on a flat road, not on an inclined road or slope. Must be a sensor issue, its gone on its own.."
Yea
"True. But Eco is more convenient in city traffic conditions. it's calm nature, no forward leap as in City and Sport mode."
"On my personal experience, City mode has given me more mileage on highway than eco mode."
"Having said that, driving in eco mode is pure pleasure ( not considering avg). Smooth and no sudden break acceleration ‚Äî just like carrying heavy vehicle with responsibility with response of road. 

Can I drive more on eco mode? Any expert?"
"Not to offend you brother, but not sure many of harrier owner care or note milage. I mean not the primary or secondary purpose of purchasing the beast is mileage any-day for me."

"I am not sure of the cause of the smell. Had the dashboard completely removed and found no rat signs.

After 2 days the smell went off by itself"
"Always stick with service centre authorised oil.
 

While developing engine and taking readings, testing, etc. They will always use only one type of oil. That's where tata authorised motor oil coming from."
Can we use this oil for Tata harrier BS VI model
"Was the recirculation mode on?

Get pics of product used and share it to me.

Also remove AC filter and check on the odour.

Hopefully they don't sprayed rat repellent in AC 

and 

AC cleaner on engine bay."
Chemical smell not dead rat smell type.
Is rat dead inside somewhere? Are you sure it's not dead rat ?
But what is the Cause of chemical smell
Place a lemon in the centre console. I tried this which was suggested by a mechanic
Clean your car ac vent with vista foam cleaning
"3 year old harrier at 69.5k odo .around 2 weeks earlier at last service on 67.5k I opted for rat repellent coating in engine bay provided at service centre by 3m I think. Now from yesterday evening a pungent chemical type smell is in the car. In stationary vehicle after 4-5 hours it is very pungent , after some driving with windows open it becomes just bearable. Anyone faced such issue ? 
Is is refrigerant leak or coating issues or anything else with ac compressor."

You can also check engine oil condition using a tester that was available on Amazon
Time to change engine oil. It's a reminder
If it was continuously glowing. It's a problem
Blinking
18000 km
Is the owner of this harrier in this group? Or is he on youtube?
Continuous or blinking
I dont think this is common issue. It could be that there is some small stone or something got into that section. One if my friend faced similar issue during one of his trips and then if was sorted.
I am getting oil signal continuously in my safari while travelling. Checked the oil level with local garage and it was good. What can be reason?
How many kms has the car done
"I purchased a Safari Facelift last year in April, and I‚Äôve been experiencing a noise issue from the suspension from left side of the vehicle even when the vehicle is in a speed of 5-10 KM/hours in a rough road. I reported this to the service team, and they mentioned that it‚Äôs a common issue in all vehicles and assured me it would be fixed but even after 2-3 service the sound is still there

Could you guys please confirm if this is actually a known/common issue, or am I being misinformed?"
This worked üí™!! Thanks a lot üôè
"Contact sc and downgrade.

Home visit possible for downgrade on request."
Get the software version downgraded to the older version
"The whole infotainment screen restarts automatically. Tried contacting sc as they said to keep the screen ON without connecting the android auto or any kind of bluetooth connection, but found out that it happens on it's own anyway"
Are you talking about the infotainment screen getting restarted or the android auto?
Try this or get it downgrade from sc
No just the same feel for every features except for the frequent automatic restarts
Also anything new you felt in this update?
Try force restarting or resetting
Which video? Can you share the link..
Got this software version installed in my safari 2023 xza+ o model and the infotainment system gets restart in every 10 min having android auto in play. Is this is stable version or should I install the lower stable versions if any

Get your brakes flushed...either the master cylinder is not fuctioning properly or there is some air in the brake line ...
Check dm
"Hey guys, today morning my brakes faded for a few seconds and then were functioning fine. Any idea what could the issue be? Brake pads have another 4-5k life in them and my beast is just shy of 48k kms, one set of brake pads already changed at 24k.

Also, after the brakes resumed working fine, the tyres were sort of skidding if I was braking hard. Any insights?"

"Got a call from tata for lubes check.
They changed break oil!"
I did have any issues honestly...the car used to jerk sometimes..other than i had given thr car for service. They found some issue with the tensioner and alternator. Tensioner i had to pay alternator was replaced under warranty.
What was the issue you were facing due to alternator?
""
My alternator was changed during the service...but i don't think there is a recall...it took them 3 days to get the approval for replacement under warranty..
Did you saw red colour brake fluid in the service?
"Hey Karthik, This is what i saw when i gave for service 2 days back."
"Dot 3 will be on red colour

Dot 4 will be on clear colour"
Which was not exist??
Dot 4 was already on bs6 norms and from factory dot 3 was not used. How can they update??
They are just updating Dot3 to 4 .
Brake oil had to be changed atleast once in 3-4 years or 30 k to 40 k kms whichever was earlier
This may be regular service schedule.
I got alternator belt changed in last service and paid for same
Which year model cars?
Stating that brake oil change & some updation
I also got call from them
I heard that tata is recalling the cars for alternator issue. Is it true?
"It is Sagar motors sector 63, i complaint to their head. He got the vehicle picked up...there was some issue which they had disagnosed so i got it done from them...the car's service was done day before yesterday, but for the past 2 days they have not got the approval for the Alternator which was changed under warranty."
Seems like treo. How was the experience? Cost wise and service wise
Sagar motors are not at all professional and they are spreading like crazy in noida. I think they would have 5-6 branches in noida only. Even the mechanics start giving gyan ki change nahi karvayan part to aap phas jaaoge beech road par üòÜ. In sector 5 they can handle 20-25 cars and they take in around 70-80.

"Sagar Motors is absolute crap... bunch of thieves. You could try Treo, Okhla."
Getting my car serviced in Noida is a real pain. I booked an appointment with one located in sector 5 and reached there on time but nobody attend my car for almost 1 hour..then i went to their service in sec 63..there apart from normal service there was some noise from the sterring system...they told me that i will have to leave my car for atleast 4 days. Since it was saturday i asked him to get tje car picked on monday..he agreed and i left. I didn't get the call on monday so calles the supervisor who attended my car..he had completely forgotten about the pickup. Now they are scheduling the pickup for next week as all their slots are booked. It is really frustrating and now i have decided to get it serviced in delhi or Faridabad. Anybody from these cities please suggest a good service center.
That's what you need exactly
Adaptor between horn and wiring
Thanks‚Ä¶ i guess these are horn pins‚Ä¶ the horn also got damaged somehow and I replaced the horn which has pins.. i would need a wire connector right if i dont want to use black-tape only?
"Horn pin available separately.

You can change horn pin.

If it was not the horn pin and manufactured as coupler. You can't able to find one."
The coupler wire of the horn has been damaged by ‚Äòrat bite‚Äô mostly‚Ä¶ mechanic taped the wire with the horn and saying coupler cannot be replaced and this is the way it needs to be fitted in such cases‚Ä¶ is it true that the coupler cannot be replaced?? Will it cause any problem if the wire is taped with the horn

"Thank you. Will start with this.
However a small amount of leaking oil into the booster is good enough to do the damage.

Will share with you what the service centre concludes."
"Yes, Possible

But we use brakes atleast 50 to 60 times in a single trip.

Leakage will cause low brake fluid in reservoir.

We can see low brake fluid  indicator in this case.."
"Got to know that what's mostly causing this problem  is the failure of Master Cylinder due to which brake oil is getting leaked and affecting brake booster.

This is a common problem in Harrier and  Safari. Will be visiting the Service Centre and proactively checking this issue."
"I have changed my disc pads  every 15k kms and the rear i have not yet changed even after 50000kms, other Suvs also have the same lifespan..XUV 700 has ever lower lifespan for disc pads...there could be some problem with the brake master cyclinder..i see disc brake lasting 30000 km as an issue...get your brake master cyclinder checked and the etnire brake system flushed.."
"Brake sluggish may have caused by air in the braking system.

Here brake application will be there but it won't be effective.

For sluggish brakes, Brake bleeding is the initial solution.

Or change brake fluid completely."
"Brake feels sluggish, not hard.

Didn't check the condition of the brake pads yet. 
Don't get the confidence while braking.

Drove Nexon and Altroz to check, braking was absolutely on point."
"But it's very obvious

Technology advancements like corner stability control

Use brakes from selected wheels for keeping the vehicle under control."
"30,000 kms for brake pads change was completely normal.

If there was a problem in brake booster 

You will face brake hardness but not excessive wear of brake pads as you are claiming"
"See a lot of queries about ineffective breaking. 
I have been experiencing the same with my Safari 2022 XZA+
Break pads changed at 30000 KM.

Is it a problem with break boosters? 
The service centre says it's how the break is. Which is definitely false.

"same for me
saved some 2k for my 3 year service"

Not sure about silver Amc but Gold Amc has to be taken within 365 days of purchasing vehicle.
"I did not take amc for 2 years, 
at 2nd year major service sa advised me to take silver amc . Saved some amount."
You won't be able to buy AMC for 2021 vehicle..it has to availed in the first year of the vehicle purchase...and if 1 major service is done without Amc then again you won't be able to purchase it..
Yup
MEANS IF I BUY SILVER AMC THEN I DONT HAVE TO PAY FOR LABOUR ETC

Amc is an inclusive of spares+labour"

"Yes absolutely. When something is good and you still have a poor opinion it's a blame. Try a poll here and see , we have 1072 members here and let's see how many are dissatisfied"
More than 100% tata owners cry not satisfied ü§£ü§£ü§£
"It's not called blaming man

It's called acceptance.. reality..

Blaming means when something is good, then if we blame that, it's called blaming.."
More than 99% of Tata Harrier and Safari owners are satisfied. The poor 1% get a bad deal whether indian or German car
"Indians mindset.

If something is from German / Europe 
Thats called world best car.."
"All these cars after 80k or 1lac kms can have 3 to 5 lacs in pocket..

One by one all major parts fails."
"Just u got satisfied means , doesn't mean others have to be fan boys..

Satisfaction is seen when we meet extreme technical issues & by that time how SC solves it.


Also reliability is seen after 80 to 1lacs kms only..

Your satisfaction level after 1lac kms you say.."
"And if you knew this so called fact, why did you buy the cheap knock off indian version? Didn't have the money to pay for a range rover i suppose and then blaming... A case of sour grapes for the fox"
Yes JLR is failure..most engine failure too
"Pardon What language are you using? As a satisfied owner of Harrier having driven 55K Kms in 2.5 years , i object to your blaming the platform and performance in the owners group. Are you an owner or are you representing competition here?"
üòÜ
"JLR are the most unreliable luxury brand globally. Tata has used JLR's platform, Jeeps engine, huyndai's Gearbox(auto), chinese infotainment, Harman's software and generic systems. TATA is more to blame for the service than the service centers...Tata has no learning process...they will not standarise any process for repeating  issues. Many sc mechanics are able to diagnose the issue at one go and able to investigate the problem correctly. But there very few such engineers. There is no proper documentation of issues and possible resolutions."
"Every Brand started to do this..
Even skoda volkswagen..that's better in one way."
They should have separate service facility for Harrier and Safari... like Nexa was done by Maruti..
Which is an another nightmare
"Before bringing something from JLR premium platform.

You should be first doing a complete top class service setup everywhere.

Bringing state of the art technology and handing over the service part to non technical/professional people will always give negative impact.

Even though they are outsourcing vendors for repair on sunroof, battery, infotainment, tyres."
"I personally gone across many bad reviews. Replies, comments and proofs from many tata customers..

Even comments are displayed on many public posts of direct company.

If service advisor was take care of customers properly. 

Customers wont be get pushed into this mindset.

I don't know even why some companies are paying these service advisors without firing them for the sake of Good."
üëçüèªüëçüèª
I will never ever recommend any one TATA car. I feel sad to say this but this is pain that I got for my all the encounters with their SC
"Can‚Äôt agree more. Tata SC is fraud. 3 years since Harrier, each service they are fooling. Not a single instruction they care. It‚Äôs all about printing money per car service. I have used other companies car but tata is not even company if you go by SC. Losers I will say"
Indian cars & european cars are night mare.

"Tata service centers are the worst...specially in Noida...i had to sell my tigor because they messed up my entire car. I complaint to the highest level but didn't get a proper resolution and so had to sell the car in the end..after owning 3 tata cars , i am done with them...will never buy another car from them. I replaced Tigor with elvate eventhough i was getting almost 3 lack discount on Curvv.."
"Personal view

In india it's better to go with cars like toyota, maruthi or honda."
"India is notorious..not a consumer supportive country.

It's not U.S or Europe 



Here we have to be cautious on our own way .

In consumer court, even voice msg not accepted.

Written statements & official mails are only considered.


None of these are authorised service centres..all these are non sense service partners.

Even I don't know this..while about the file case only i came to know.

They should mention in boards  as Bosch Franchisee..

Cleverly none of the bosch franachise service partners write or bosch insist them to mention in boards."
"I already said the matter in the group..

Then what is further needed.

If your is direct to the point,I can tell whatever"
No problem. No explanations. üëçüèªüëçüèª
"Then how come you look into this matter..
I don't understand"
No
Are u bosch employee?
"Ohh thats bad, yeah i meant noida one‚Äôs is having good repo. Also in delhi there are many independent sc giving good quality work."
"DM me the full matter.

I will look into it and see what I can do.."
"Worst case scenario is, bosch won't even provide technical support to them if something goes wrong.

Only bosch kits,spares provided to the franchise centres.

2 years I struggled 15 lacs value lost within a day..

Now, again I need to spend 15 to 20lacs to get new car"
"Moreover, Bosch Is rude.

There is no proper customer care number for car service.


To find out that customer care no.itself i spent  3 days like CBI investigation"
"Bosch, tvs etc all are just franchise, service centre official name is under the name of some other name"
"Bosch is not an authorised service centre..

Local people or mechanics just take franachise from bosch.

Means ,they provide software, bosch spare parts to them..

Bosch team, burnt my car engine & now the car got scrapped..


All these are just franchises..
If something goes wrong they won't even involve to solve the issue..

Simply, bosch said it's there franachise & they are not responsible for anything.

Only the person who took the franchise is responsible.

To save 30k, I lost my car itself"
"If in Pune , Panchajanya warje is good ."
Change sc don't skip schedule
"I also heard many news as you told.

But keeping in mind 
Road safety & Passenger safety

It's always better to follow service schedule rather than skipping it. My personal advise.

Many defective parts were found and changed in scheduled service. Both minor and major service"
I am only getting car serviced because of warranty otherwise i would have get it done it at bosch cheaper and much better quality
"Also, after dealing with tata sc for 3 yrs i dont trust their sc guys at all. They will bill it but not do it. Same is not case with maruti or hyundai."
They dont even bother in major service leave minor one. I had to ask them for brake cleaning as i discussed before in grp and they were like kya need hai. Once they did it took ard 30 mins as it was in bad shape and i told him to do it properly not just for show. Minor is just to mint money this is what i believe.
"One small change

Not only checkup

Check and adjust

As well as

Check level and top-up

+

Brake cleaning

+

Check proper components working and lubrication.."
Yeah in my case as well they asked to avoid that minor service. They dont do anything as such just checkup and charge 3-4000 for barely half hour service.

Anyone have experience with Hiker brand wipers? It's from Varroc.
"Again it is your call....it is not about the number of services but doing them is a timely manner is imp. Mid year services are generally checkups and no actual work is done in these services. Don't write to Tata or higlight that there has been any lapse from ur end specially on record. Simply take ur car to sc , they will themselves suggest you go for the major service instead of the check up. I don't see any sense in spending 3k for minor service and 15 to 20k again next month for the same work, given it usually dosen't impact ur warranty."
Please do the double servicing. Which you are mentioning..
üëç
Please write to Tata motors asking the same and also clarify that warranty would be intact

My point is the 4th paid service was due on Dec 2024 and 5th paid service will be due in June 2025 which is a major service.So shall i do 5th major service now or 4th service. Suppose if i do 4th service now then again i have to do the 5th major service in June 2025.(Please note As per maintenance chart oil change should be carried out at every 12 Months or 15k kms whichever is earlier).
They will happily do the the 4th service..it is revenue for them...
"They will allow to do. As the kms are lower.

It's mandatory not to skip any service. Atleast till end of warranty.

They will accept inability to be on time rather than not at all presented.."
"Yes, better be checked with TaMo if they still allow"
The mid year service has to be done within 6 months or 7500kms( which one is earlier) of the major service...so the car has already missed the 4th service... so the warranty clause would have anyways lapsed
"Warranty *may* be void, depends on manufacturer's discretion and they could site those as one of the reason if they wish, so why give them a chance"
My fuel pump was changed under warranty...the advisor used to handle all my vehicles and advised me not to waste money on mid year services...
"Ask him the same in writing, SA is no authority if manufacturer voids warranty for the same reason üòÅ"
Dosen't affect your warranty. The mid year service is only for checkup and coolant topups. The sc guy advised me not to take the mid year service.
Ok.. thanks
"Contact sc and discuss this.

Don't skip service.

Voids warranty"

"New vehicles will have this due to low tolerance.

In city usually less than 4 gears were used. On highway more than 4 gears were used.

So the highest used gear depends on the driving scenario.

Kindly look into matter indepth. Find if you are capable of getting any rotational sequence.

Or give drive more kms. If there was a problem it will get more. If newness is the problem. It will get sorted out.

But on amt transmission - grid self tuning option was available.

Again you are telling that car engine will strain on eco mode.

No bro it won't... Eco mode will only strain lower cc car but not harrier.

Harrier is a higher cc car. 

What you are claiming may applicable for engine below 1000cc..

If you feel like your car was straining on eco mode on city traffic conditions. Keep that perception with you. No need to push that perception on others without proper piece of evidence to prove!!!

If it's straining as you are claiming then harrier won't sell this much. Manufacturer came into play and will notify on manual and other areas not use eco mode on city traffic conditions. Today conversation won't be happening.

Finally you called me brainless, common senseless, dumb and idiot because I am not complied with your perception. 



Do you have any idea on how many steps involved before releasing a model such as harrier which is a flagship of Tata motors???



Do you think manufacturer will create an engine which straining on eco mode and sell it to people??

"*Got this from google AI *

No, driving a Tata Harrier in Eco mode does not cause any damage to the car, it primarily optimizes fuel consumption by adjusting engine and transmission settings. 

Here's a more detailed explanation:

**Eco Mode Functionality:**Eco mode in most modern cars, including the Harrier, is designed to improve fuel efficiency by: 
**Adjusting Transmission:** It typically shifts gears at lower engine RPMs, which can lead to slightly slower acceleration but better fuel economy. 
**Limiting Throttle Response:** The throttle response is also made less sensitive, encouraging a smoother and more relaxed driving style. 



**No Harm to the Engine:**The changes made by Eco mode are temporary and do not cause any long-term damage to the engine or transmission. 


**When to Use Eco Mode:**
Eco mode is best suited for situations where you prioritize fuel economy over performance, such as: **Long Highway Drives:** When you're cruising at a steady speed with minimal acceleration and braking. 
**Relaxed Driving:** When you're not in a hurry and prefer a smoother, more relaxed driving experience. 



**When to Avoid Eco Mode:**
You should avoid using Eco mode when you need quick acceleration or responsive handling, such as: **City Driving:** In stop-and-go traffic, the reduced throttle response can make Eco mode feel sluggish. 
**Overtaking:** When you need to quickly accelerate to overtake other vehicle"

Again this is a constant. There was no connection between switching to Eco mode. The workings will be as same as driving at any mode on lower speeds"
"Here it mentioned

 in eco mode the engine does not receive enough Lubrication.

There won't be any changes in engine lubrication if you switch to eco mode. It's constant and oil pump is there in the engine to make sure lubrication will be there at all RPM"
"Listen to everyones comment,

[Rohit](tg://user?id=1256627613) premakar

As you claiming. Engine is stressed 

Are you able to show variation in engine noise or on any other parameters??"
If engine is straining. You should check if parking brake was applied or you are using clutch wrongly.
"High Torque requires more power

Statement is wrong. 

This is where gears are used. To vary and maintain torque and speed proportion.

Eco mode don't cuts fuel. It governs the fuel.

Engine won't strain on driving in city with 2 occupants. On eco mode."
Again wrong statement
Point proved ..thanks..
"No worries bro..

I am not hurt. üëçüèª

Don't comment again"
Governs the fuel
I am so sorry i asked you to use ur brain...
Why don't you prove it in a video??
I'll do it for you anways...high torque require more power...eco mode cuts/restricts the fuel to the engine..it i will strain the engine ..
"Stop commenting about using my Brian.

Final warning"
"Don't be a retard

Read the question.

What's the relationship between eco mode and gear ratio you are mentioning.

I am not asking about common factor on gear ratio.

I am just asking what are you trying to say."
Gear rations are calculated to  compensate for the torque requirement at different speeds...'torque calculation' ...rest use ur own brain to connect the dots..
Here
Bro that is what I am also telling from first place
But in Google it says eco can be used in city driving
"There was no answer on bhp or Nm produced by engine on eco mode.

You are assuming

A 2000cc engine will produce low torque on eco mode!!!"
There was no comments on the owners manual instructions
Still you didn't mention about the relationship between eco mode and gear ratio.
No I prefer watching your comments
Ok then go back which ever cartoons you watch...üòÇüòÇ
It's better to watch your comments here rathar than watching chotta beem. üòÑüòÑüòÑ
Cartoon network shut down few years back.
It is difficult for you to understand and comprehend....please go back to watching cartoon network..
"Sir.

Gear ratio is different.

What is the connection you are thinking between gear ratio and eco mode?"
That is how gear ratios are calculated..

"How much power engine requires to at low speeds.

This statement is wrong."
üòÇüòÇüòÇ it best for everyone..if it remains between you guys only...
"What I teach people is between me and my people.

Shut up and mind your own business.."
"All you mentioning is low torque.

But don't have value for that.

This is not common sense but a pure maths and physics.

If you don't know the bhp or Nm torque comparison.

Don't misguide people.


Does it mentioned in owners manual not to drive in eco mode on city drive??

Do you think you are higher than manufacturer's instructions??"
"Don't wonder.

Go to a college

Study well

Work on 5+ top companies

Undergo 20 + trainings

Later you will realise and don't wonder"
"What do you mean by common sense.

It's a 2000cc car."
I wonder what you have been teaching people in th course you have been selling....it common knowledge on how much power  any engine requires to at low speeds...gearboxes are used yo compensate for that inital high requirement of torque....this is something you learn in school. The torque equation... 4 x4  cars have 4 low for high torque situations..
"I guess i don't have a chart for common sense...but if there is one , will surely share it with you..."
üòÅ
"Do you have any calculations to prove your theory?

Do you have chart of how much bhp and nm produced in eco mode on low speeds/rpm??

Relevant information will be helpful to beleive you"
All the hybrid cars use electric engine for the inital stages...VW group shuts down one cyclinder to save fuel on higway speeds.
1 or 2 people is neglible weight for a 2 ton car...starting torque requires the most power. This is why eco mode is not ideal for start or stop traffic.
"Small changes 

Eco mode governs the fuel supply"
Eco mode restricts the fuel supply. So when the car is cruzing or is on highway...only the overtake speed are affected.
"This high torque required if occupants and load is high. Not for 1 or 2 people.

Also cc is higher. Hence you can drive in eco"
It is not recomended in start and stop traffic or where there is regular braking..the torque required at low speed is high and will put some strain on engine .
"People are driving in Eco mode at highways.

I told you already. Once there was harrier. There is no other car!!!

This will lure you to highspeeds. Please be speed conscious while driving üôèüèª"
Eco mode is not for highway for sure
"This is suitable for Tiago or any other lower cc engine.

But not for safari and harrier"
"It won't make any changes or hurt the engine if 1 or 2 occupants driving.

If it was putting extra load like you are saying ARAI won't approve the car. üòÅ

Eco mode is fine for traffic. Unless 2+ occupants in the car."
It is not recomended to drive in eco mode in city traffic. It will put extra load on the engine and in anyways won't improve your milage. Eco mode is best suited for highways and crusing speeds. Where there is minimal braking.
"No restrictions 

Drive

But not on full load or with 2+ occupants"
"Is it okay to drive in city traffic on Economy Mode? With City Mode, I am getting a mileage of only 10.5 kmpl with AC on in my Harrier Automatic"
Hi - Can anyone share the link for front wipers for harrier 2022 model.
"Hi all,

As summer was starting up

These are the maintenance needed 

1) Don't park in direct sunlight. Avoid prolonging parking in direct sunlight.

2) Lift the windshield wipers while parking the car. Prevents spoilage of wipers. Both front and rear.

3) clean the cowl panel occasionally

4) Don't keep anything in dashboard as prolonged exposure to sun may cause problems 

5) Before switching off the car make sure AC was on fresh air mode.

6) while taking the car from direct sunlight. Open all windows fully. Drive like that for 2-3 mins. After that switch on ac. Close the front windows first and later close the rear ones.

7) if you are getting a bad symptom like headache, etc after inhaling hot air produced at the time of parking. Just take a cup of ice and inhale it for 1-2 mins. Seek medical care if symptoms prolong.

8) close the outside mirrors at the time of parking.

9) Change tyres immediately if you crossed 4 years or grid depth was less than 1 mm. Prevents bursting. 

10) Please please please make sure to check the bottom of the car before starting. Our four legged friends and other animals used to take shelter in bottom of the car. üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª

You have to change oil and filter again riding it after 1000 kms from previous oil change
"What is 3 , double oil change?"
"Good suggestion üòÉ. Here is what chatgpt says...not sure if it's correct.
The engine oil capacity of Indian cars varies depending on the make, model, and engine type. Here‚Äôs a general guideline for popular car segments in India:

Small Hatchbacks (800cc - 1200cc)

Maruti Alto, Renault Kwid, Hyundai Santro ‚Äì ~2.5 to 3.5 liters

Maruti Swift, Hyundai Grand i10, Tata Tiago ‚Äì ~3.0 to 4.0 liters


Compact Sedans & Hatchbacks (1200cc - 1500cc)

Maruti Baleno, Hyundai i20, Honda Amaze, Tata Tigor ‚Äì ~3.5 to 4.5 liters


Mid-Size Sedans & SUVs (1500cc - 2000cc)

Hyundai Verna, Honda City, Maruti Ciaz ‚Äì ~3.7 to 4.5 liters

Maruti Brezza, Hyundai Creta, Kia Seltos, Tata Harrier ‚Äì ~4.0 to 5.5 liters


Diesel Cars (1000cc - 2000cc)

Hyundai i20 Diesel, Maruti Dzire Diesel ‚Äì ~3.5 to 4.5 liters

Mahindra XUV700, Toyota Innova Crysta Diesel ‚Äì ~5.0 to 7.5 liters


Large SUVs & MPVs (2000cc and above)

Toyota Fortuner, Ford Endeavour, Mahindra Scorpio ‚Äì ~6.0 to 9.0 liters


Engine oil capacity also depends on whether you're changing only the oil or both the oil and the oil filter."

"Dear all,

This is how people will get  confused and confuse others.

1) Use recommended grade oil. Same will be tested on engines till 2 lakh to 5,00,000 kms.

2) Oil was having other properties apart from Lubrication. Non recommended grade oil will cause issues.

3) If you are not convinced with regular oil. Use synthetic oil.

4) Do a double oil change once in every 30k to 40k kms for better cleansing effect.

5) Grade of oil varies that was mainly depends on petrol or diesel engines as well as climatic conditions.

6) Grading of the oil remains same till your hot gauge was on correct temperature!!!

7) There was no problem in using recommended grade oil. If you change it. There may be possibilities of fried piston rings and many hydraulics damages!!!

8) lower operating temperature engines will have higher life, lower maintenance cost, light weight and easy cooling capacity."

"Fykip

1) Always replace engine oil at service centre. Prevents many problems.

2) Always replace oil filter whenever you are replacing oil. It's always oil+oil filter even if it was 2 separate parts. 

3) I am not going to bad mouth any freewill or choice for choosing replacement location. But cleansing effect can be attained if you replace oil couple of times in 1000kms duration. Yes also filter.

4) You can buy oil from them and ask sc if they are willing to replace the oil you bought from outside. If they accept buy oil from them and give to sc."

"Missing points.

The stickiness of the engine oil was like gum attached to engine parts.

Whenever the engine starts there will ready and existing oil in all wear and tear parts. Which helps initial Lubrication without any delay."
"Synthetic engine oil and natural engine oil have distinct differences in terms of their composition, performance, and benefits.

Natural Engine Oil (Conventional Oil)
1. *Derived from petroleum*: Refined from crude oil.
2. *Molecular structure*: Variable molecular structure, which can lead to breakdown under extreme temperatures.
3. *Viscosity*: Thins out at high temperatures, losing lubricity.
4. *Engine protection*: Provides adequate protection for everyday driving conditions.
5. *Price*: Generally less expensive than synthetic oil.

Synthetic Engine Oil
1. *Chemically formulated*: Created from chemical compounds to provide a uniform molecular structure.
2. *Molecular structure*: Consistent molecular structure, which resists breakdown under extreme temperatures.
3. *Viscosity*: Maintains viscosity at high temperatures, providing better lubricity.
4. *Engine protection*: Offers superior protection for extreme driving conditions, such as:
    - High temperatures
    - Low temperatures
    - Frequent stop-and-go traffic
    - Towing or hauling heavy loads
5. *Price*: Generally more expensive than conventional oil.

Key Benefits of Synthetic Oil
1. *Improved fuel efficiency*: Synthetic oil's consistent viscosity can lead to better fuel economy.
2. *Increased engine longevity*: Synthetic oil's superior lubricity and wear protection can help extend engine life.
3. *Better cold-weather performance*: Synthetic oil flows more easily in cold temperatures, making engine startup easier.
4. *Enhanced engine cleanliness*: Synthetic oil's detergent properties help keep the engine cleaner.

When deciding between synthetic and natural engine oil, consider your driving habits, climate, and vehicle manufacturer's recommendations."
Does anyone feel 2024 Harrier breaks are less responsive or less bite at low speed? Not sure whether this is an issue in just my car. My third service is due in 3 weeks. Shall I get it checked now or wait for the 3rd service? Will they charge for it during 3rd service?

No problem. You can use synthetic
Actually warranty is there for one more year
Synthetic is best after warranty period. Increases the life of engine by reducing wear and tear.

"Hi guys, yesterday i happened to drop my harrier for it's 60k km service. During the service, the brake pads were changed which was driven for just 19k kms since last replacement.

"Thanks, just confirmed gold 4 years. 

SA will try to play most of the time and we need to break our head to negotiate so I prefer peace of mind.

Silver and gold there are only 2 difference 

Silver can be paid YOY and gold need to be paid upfront

Gold cover additional parts which are worth of price difference. 

If we take a chance and lucky enough then we dan save about 35-40k in a span of 4 year but in case of any breakdown or technical issue similar amount need to be spent. 

As rightly said if one is sure about usage and having technical knowledge the silver otherwise gold is better"
"If you have knowledge and are very particular in including only required items in each service, also do not hesitate in removing unwanted items pushed by service advisor

Cost will be lower.

Don't misunderstand.

Replacing non oe is a risk factor. That will be considered as alterations.

Usually design Approval will be taken for oe brake pads. Replacing oe brake pads = non approved modifications"
Yes
"whether is it written in Manual or some other way?
Brake pads are like tires. so if we change to Non OEM should not affect warranty IMO. 
but need to validate with service centres or experts."

Creta is not having immobilizer. I spoken about this already
Harrier may not be on top but as per crime reports creta is 2nd position and its not a cheap car. I believe they will also have reasonably good locking system but innovative thieves find the way out so its always better to be careful.

"Car theft is key challenge even today, thief stealing the vehicle in the night and get it dismantled even before sunrise.

Having said that, I love harrier like anything. It‚Äôs my addiction. Tata shall be doing good as it‚Äôs our nations pride. But nothing works trust me if you have criminal service centers.

 i doubt if buyers are aware of this as i see most of us go for some short of coating for easy maintenance"

In my case i had to claim the insurance
I also faced the similar situation in my new safari when both the right side tyres got cut due to stone after driving for just 500km. I believe company fitted tyre are not as good as one which are available with tyre dealers. I heard that car manufacturers get specially manufactured tyre from OEM which are cheaper in quality and cost

"Hi all, I have a 2022 safari and recently am getting flapping sound from right side back wheel if I go above 80. At times it comes at 80 and at times at 100. Once I took it to SC but they Just said nothing serious and might be because of stones in tyres.. but still issue not resolved. Anyone faced similiar issue? It has run 28k km."
"Hi dear all,

2 things I observed today and giving solutions.

1) Extended warranty - Enroll asap. The greater the age of the vehicle the greater the price. Go for maximum period of time. Amc gold package combined with EW will give you best possible lowest service price. For new owners go with top model, do underchassis, enroll extended warranty, enroll amc gold for a maximum time period, put pvc flooring tension free. Enroll insurance that supports minimum 2 free tows (Not marketing this).

2) If there is a slope that your steering position is not straight and you are trying to climb in a turned manner after halting. (It will put more effort to your drive train). - Always straight the steering and go to crawling and turn, exit the turn. ONLY FOR STOP AND TURN. Your vehicle can manage easily on flat and downslope surfaces!!!"
Do anyone faced this issue?contacted service centre many times.. But this message is popping up after some days
Yup. MIne is a year old faclift harrier. The noise in rear left door is because of the sunshades.

Hi. I am owning a tata safari. Planning to change my tires from current 235/70/r16 to 265/70/r16 to make it more stable. Will there be any performance or legal issue? Also will it cause insurance policy claim issue if there is an accident since the tyre is not specific for the xe model.

"Dear all,

I didn't know if I covered this topic or not.

Hydroplaning (plane ing) that how to pronounce it.

During this monsoon season there may be water stagnation in many roads especially in corners/bends.

During those times

Please make sure you don't cross 35 to 45 kmph in speedometer.

What happens here was when you drive in a good speed at water stagnation. Due to SURFACE TENSION of water your car will start to glide on the surface of the water. Which leads to loss of steering or over steering. Loss of control of the vehicle. At the high speeds in water of above 50kmph the tread and grid of tyres won't help to separate the water.

Btw

Loaded Axle weight of each side will vary and vehicle becomes less weight on high speeds!!!

Please take this as a caution and drive slow üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª"
Make sure to do tyre rotation for every 5000 kms to 10000 kms

"I like to point out...

If we are not able to release clutch fully

Avoid revving and don't shift the gear.

Don't use half clutch apart from first gear!!!

Use clutch for moving and in bumper to bumper traffic only on first gear.

From 2nd gear don't use clutch

2nd upshift and downshift
Press and release.

3rd upshift and downshift
Press and release.

4th upshift and downshift
Press and release.

5th upshift and downshift
Press and release.

6th upshift and downshift
Press and release.

Use these gears only on full clutch!!!"
Automatic is always preferred.
"Although manual is good but go for automatic because the transmission is butter smooth 

Unless you are driving freak go for manual

Also try taking test drive for automatic variant"
Avoid half clutch. It‚Äôs old school habit. Modern car has sensitive clutch. Accelerate more in less gear than half clutch is higher gear.
"Took a Test drive on Harrier Manual. I don't find the clutch to be hard. Many people complain about this and also say it is difficult to drive in city traffic. Also people say about clutch burning.

Though I had to spend 50k and got all my tryes changed for peace of mind on long drives after the incident
You can raise it to tyre manufacturer directly and claim warranty.  Apollo refunded me about 50% of tyre amount last month.needed hard follow up though
but that is mostly covered in Tyre cover add-on provided by Insurance companies so if it suits someone's requirement...do consider getting that add-on

This is for your kind information.

Tyre puncture or accidental cut was not covered under warranty!!!

Please drive and park carefully!!!

"Agree. But Whatever, without reliability nothing is useful.. 

Dsg failure even dq250, injector & fuel pumps, mechatronics, now epc & clutch failure. 

Just for speed we can't have car. 

Car runs for 100kms like rocket & takes rest in asc for another 2 to 3 months, where bunch of rocket engineers from another planet comes & do research to rectify the fault for 3 months & at last they simply say, change the whole part.. 

I agree car is good drive.. Good driving dynamics & safety.. 

But reliability is negative.. 
Can't have this car after 1.5lac kms, after that each & everyday is nightmare


Instead of over engineering, they should provide reliable var first. 


I love honda more than that.. Driving pleasure,Streering response etc, peace of life, since it's NA engine, the power alone not like VAG.

After smart engines, all their models have major failures

Before 2009 it's ok.. Old Laura, Octavia etc. 

In India the best exterior looks always rules the market. 

But, as a customer, instead being a fan boy of any cars, keep documenting the negatives, failures of the car in group, at the end in case if we need to take it to consumer court, only these dossiers speak effectively there.. 

Beyond this, in India, only we have to cautious while taking such cars, since India is not a consumer supportive country, winning a case & proving is difficult & it takes 1.5 to 20 years for a case to get verdict.. 

As per my view & experience.. 
Get a reliable car. 

Never buy any car from YouTube reviews.."

"Yep few customers are lucky.. But, after 1.5 lac kms.. Slowly oil leaks will start from most major places.. Keep an eye on it.

Last service, cabin mirror someone looted.. Asked asc to change it.. Just mirror alone, cos holder was there on windshield. 

They said OEM price of that mirror is 16000rs.

Was shocked.. Later changed it for 1000rs from another skoda asc but not oem"
"Sad to hear!! Yes, they unnecessarily charge extra by putting some add ons without even asking us, thus increasing the bill. Also the maintenance even goes higher once it's 8+ years old.Luckily, till date my Vento never gave up on me and i hope it continues to serve without hassles..."
"Maintenance is not on higher side. 

They cheat.. cos they change everything as a whole unit. 

My fuel pump socket was slightly burnt, they asked to change the whole fuel pump for it. 

Engine bay gasket oil leak. Instead of changing the gasket, they said, I need to change the whole engine door.. 

Skoda said they won't give the gasket alone.. 

Gasket price - just 2500rs
But the door price - 35k

Like these only they do with all customers.. 

Last time, a small oil seal leak on the turbo impeller.. Which gave oil leak & turbo hissing sound. 

Asc said I need to change the whole turbo.. Price 2lacs

Incentives & service bill target are another crap, cos of this only asc also try to fool customers.. 


AC was not switching on. 

Asc said AC Freon leak, said need to change whole AC unit except compressor.. 
Later local shop, just charged gas & said there is no leak at all.. 

So many stories with them.."
"I got 80AH Amaron Flo for 8600 with old battery exchange. Exide 80AH was 9100. There is a huge difference on 12-1500 in the cost of 78AH vs 80AH. So if someone‚Äôs planning to keep their vehicle for only next two-three years, 78AH should be a good option."

There was a customer in pune, whose car broke down at meghalaya en route to Cherrapunji.. 

Late night at 2am with family. 

By the time, the nearby asc is Only in WB kolkata. Towing fees alone 2lacs.

Later they Introduced RSA for 10 years. 

Superb - within 5 years 3 times mechatronics failure. Delhi owner.. Almost 3 lacs for 3rd time mechatronics failure. 

Even last month two cars broke down one at HIMACHAL trip another at somewhere nearby to hyderabad. 

Like this last of night mare stories.

Anytime, anywhere, anyhow breakdown guaranteed.

Ask asc to check pcv
Currently it's spilling drop by drop
"If too much oil spill is there, then check with asc"

It took an hour to unscrew. But finally replaced and all stats intact in my car.

Did you mean to say you burnt the clutch instead of burning the whole vehicle? Burning the whole vehicle means losing lot of money...so a bit confused
How many are from Bangalore in the group?

"Horn was fixed, left side horn wire was loose. For speaker they told that we've Hermann speaker so need set call and then I've to give car for 1 day in sc once they visit ...."

He burnt the clutch or the car ? Looks like he is looking for insurance
No but i was frustated by rust on different parts and problems in car...no one want to take the car for tensions on everyday basis
"So you burn the car, did that justify your money?"
Failure of made in india
No to tata
Bro i didn't mentioned that car was burnt during driving . I put the car on flame as it was useless as clutch burnt out at so low kms is not justifying customer money
"I gone through this case.

He replaced his clutch assembly at 23000 kms.

As per his statement He himself burnt the car.

No need to go to highway‚Ä¶ you should be able to do it while car is parked. Just take car to open area. In notifications on infotainment system you will get option to reset it. Your car should be on‚Ä¶ it will take ur rPM to about 2.5-3k for 10-15 mins and done.

"It may void warranty , but they may never get to know Wherever you do, just ensure it's handled by experts as rain sensors need to be fixed cleanly to avoid any issue later. People have reported issues with them as well as leak after changing windshields even at SC"
"Hi All, Need suggestions on below

1. My 8months old harrier has a windscreen crack. Harrier is with ADAS (ADV+A). Iam planning to replace the screen.

Can i get it replaced outside the TATA MOTORS service center? Will it void any warranty?

If anyone has got it replaced whats the cost of the screen with sensors? 

Thanks in advance"
"You can check with different TATA dealers. You will get the best price. Only benefit of getting it from Tata is that the claim process is hassle free...you have to drop ur vehicle, fill in the details and rest would be handled by them.all the policies are cashless you will have to pay only the filing charges..usualy the surveyour vistis the next day itself in case the policy is from Tata...other policies it takes 2 to 3 days atleast."

Extended warranty is very important as gearbox or engine are very expensive in case of any technical issues.
"Extended warranty is for 5 years or 200000km whichever is earlier. Since your running is less , for year 4&5 costs of manufacturing parts will not be covered.

Turning off the Ac and starting it again solves the problem for 10 mins or so and again it back to normal. Went to the mechanic, he told radiator clog issue, cleaned tur radiator n condenser still issue persists. Now he is telling to leave the car for 3-4 days. Can anyone suggest what might be the causes?"

"Firstly the flywheel comes under warranty, while clutch plate does not. Burnt out clutch plate won't cause the the flywheel to get damaged but a damaged flywheel will damage the clutch. So, you will have to argue with them on that. Do not agree to them saying that flywheel is also burnt out. Argue with them..then write to higher authority ...that is the only way out. It very difficult to get work done in SC, so all the best."

"As mentioned earlier, this issue is coming in multiple vehicles (Safaris & Harriers). This will be noticed by TATA if everyone who faced this issue starts reporting it."
"The company policies will be to conduct investigation and root cause analysis then do the same for multiple customers and then make a survey of it.

After all these companies will take a management level call what to do

It's long process that won't happen just because of one client complaint"
Which should be fixed by TATA not only in new cars but for their existing customers as well
So basically it is a design flaw.
"As i mentioned we earlier, battery acid is basically a diluted H2SO4 so that is the reason for choosing sealed battery type, if during maintenance they are tinkering with it or if there is any leakage then owner has to verify and check for their safety. 

I am not defending tata here, but we can keep a plastic cover below and around battery to make sure leakage is not damaging anything else around it."
Guys just a question. What was their leakage from the battery?  Was there any damage? Usually there should not be any leakage
16k only
After how many kms you are seeing this brother ?
"Yes pls, as I had to get my car towed to SC on my own expense as TATA customer care was telling me that their towing vehicle will come at 12 AM (I called them around 6 PM)."
Any suggestions on how to escalate this issue? I already tried customer care but it is of no use as they will direct it to SC only
"Point noted.

Let this be a warning to others and check your Tatas checked well in advance for that battery leak"

See video on YouTube. it seems to be frequently occurring issue in Safari & Harrier. TATA should improve the design and quality of this pipe
Ideally TATA should fix it without charging anything from their customers
"After seeing the replacement of this pipe, one thing I understood is that there is a design flaw as this pipe leads to the clutch slave cylinder beneath the battery tray. The pipe bursting is due to acid from the battery, indicating a design flaw."
"Unfortunately, I was told that its replacement is not covered under extended warranty and I was charged Rs 7500"
"I faced clutch pipe issue this Monday, it got ruptured while I was driving."
""
""
"That's interesting, I did not inspect the battery. Will update once done."
These battery are sealed maintanence free so acid can not come out unless there is a mechanical impact and crack has happened.
"Small update on the problem, it seems the cause of the problem is due to battery acid leak or something and that caused the clutch pipe to fail"
"For any car, do not wait to get empty, it effects fuel pump."
"Keeping fuel atleast above 30-40% mark will just boost fuel pump life.

This applies to Harrier or Safari only.
Not saying for any other car."
"If fuel goes down in fuel tank, this fuel pump starts overheating and there's the problem of its failure in Harriers and Safaris."
Your Harrier or Safari has a fuel pump which needs to remain submerged at all time. This helps it run at normal temperatures.
I had this issue. SC changed the fuel pump.
"Did you have a fuel pump failure? Is this what Service Center guys informed? I've always had other 8 year old, close to 80K KM run diesel cars which I always used to refill after hitting reserve and I never had issues."

Back side is having some heat due to direct sun rays hitting it and bottom side of seat is relatively cold. Hence the effect you are feeling

"I got a call from quality control department (manufacturing plant Pune). They are asking for all the issues with service centers/ breakdowns that I faced.

"And since Iam from automobile business, can very much tell you, all the Indian car brands STILL don't know how to give a fuss free software experience. They all suck.

All the Japanese or korean cars can never give you a feel of solid car, even CBU like Tucson

And all the German or American cars can never give you easy on pocket experience"
I don't mind going a little far away if a service center has good reviews + better track records.
"Just follow three things whenever buying a new car

1. Never buy a new model in its first two years of launch. Even if it's a facelift

2. Always keep yourself atleast little upto date with know how of how a car mechanicals work. In age of social media, it's not a hard thing to do. 

3. Google maps is your friend. Before heading to any service center, just have a good look at it's reviews there. You will get an idea if you spent some time reading atleast 70% reviews there. Choose to go accordingly."
"Whoever plan to buy whatever car, Just take a thorough test drive and then decide.

If a Tata car really nails it for you, none of the negative feedbacks will effect you, similarly if a Xuv700 interests you, all the horror stories of Tata will sound more to you."

"That is the problem, Tata Motors doesn‚Äôt usually reply to mails on customer grievances, there is no alternate way to speak with them. Even on twitter they respond with a general line ‚Äúour best minds are on it and you will hear from us shortly‚Äù. I have never heard from them back.

Totally true
Anyone installed audio system in smart varient??
"Yes that is true
I had a very bad experience with tata
I bought a tigor in 2018 mfg 2017
After 4 days from the date of delivery it broke down on highway near Jaipur.
Than they had sent RSA and rectified the issue...after that multiple breakdown happened with my car and finally I have sold that car ......couple of months later when I was looking again for a new car...I called tata guys at my place for the test drive of Nexon...and at that time the sales person told me that the reason behind your car breakdown was....the engine was changed in your  car.....yeh log sirf car bechte nahi chipkaate hai....."
"So you are telling that entire tata service centre pan India was not having knowledge towards the product??

And tata service centre people are lazy??"
"safari or harrier as a car is best . two things u need to look at preeence of hybrids - always advantage .

service centre guys are not uptodate with new adas and its effects which will take time for all company cars.

No. You can approach sc or showroom. Meanwhile check for any water leakage in that bent area. From the top.

The bonnet has additional supports underneath and so dry denting is not possible. So you have to get it repainted IF you seek perfection.

One of my friend had a similar issue in his safari. Drive modes were inactive and he was not able to cross 2k rpm. Hence asked. His SC also told the same reason as yours.
"Steering is behaving normally, easily able to cross 2k rpm, car easily touches 100kmph on highway. SC guys are saying this may be becoz of DPF regen issue-need to check first but display shows normal DEF quality and i drove the car 400km in past 1 week only on highways so don‚Äôt understand this. They have asked to submit car tomorrow for checkup."
Is steering stiff? Are you able to cross 2k rpm?
"If engine is idling smoothly, I don't think theres a problem here. Else it might a case of bad fuel"
"Connected to a cig lighter socket with a fuse in line.

"So after facing door noise issue for close to 5000kms, I finally did a small DIY myself and it worked wonders. It's been more than 6000kms and it's working absolutely fine.


Issue - grinding noise from driver and rear right door. No matter road surface, once car starts moving, doors started making this noise

SA - took to TATA and they lubricated rubber beading. It worked but temporarily.
Later they suggested tk realign doors which was too much for me to do on my new car.

Solution - bought this (pic below) and applied. Hush cabin restored."
"What u want to convey.. Nothing is going to affect?

Magnetism, emf etc are different..not exactly same. Why so much out of topic.

So suddenly I got confused between

Magnetism, voltage and amps??"
"No such issues, SC confirmed my suspicions of the light being a coding error."
"Don't confuse magnetism & voltage, amps. 

Try to avoid in such unwanted things, is my point."
"I am unable to accept this point as it was going out of the topic. If you are that much constrained about magnetism. Let me clarify you something. You are living in a world where there are 2 magnetic poles north and south. And sun emits all kind of radiation.

So please avoid unnecessary panicking."
"Irrespective of what phone you have or you don't have a phone or you have car with wireless charging or not.

"But sir

The voltage is 5 

and amps was also low.

5 volt emf doesn't even produce the effect of small magnet that was inside earphone."
The EMF emissions from wireless chargers are typically low and well within established safety limits. Reputable health organizations have concluded that the use of wireless chargers does not pose a significant health risk.
Nope. It‚Äôs like fuel only. So no issues with warranty.
Thanks Rohit. My question was whether filling DEF by own and not through SC would impact warranty?
"Also, Def costs 55 to 70 rs litre, SC charges 110 plus the cloth and all.."
Def and its components are not covered under warranty. So it makes no difference.

"Ok, will do. Thanks."
Yes you have to
"My Safari had a check engine light light up yesterday, today it is not present. Shall I still visit the SC for safety?"
"You have to make a special groove in the ground in order to avoid using parking brakes.

Mark the wheel areas and make groove at 8-12 CMS depth and 1.5  feet x 1.5 feet. On all four tyres.

Settle your car in that groove so no parking brakes or park shifting needed.

But do know one thing. Sticky brakes are a sign of poor maintenance of brake components."
"So we can't deactivate auto parking brake while on P ?
Need this as temporary solution as my car is 99% parked on a flat surface. Keeping parking brakes engaged sometimes lead to brake pad sticking issue."
"One question- Considering I have extended warranty left for 2 more years, can I refill the def myself by ordering Tata genuine DEF online myself or should I do it through SC only?"
""
"1,

Parking brake is a factor of safety feature.

2,

Ofcourse you can deactivate and put it on p for only shorter period of time.

3,

If you deactivate the parking while your car was at p. It will create tension in gearbox or transmission. It's like putting it on gear without handbrakes.

If you like to avoid Fatigue failure. This is not the one you can play with!!!

That's why service centres are there."

"My car manual is missing.

When I lock the mirrors are closing but the doors are not getting locked
My tata harrier doors are not getting lockes when locking with the key? Anyone faced this issue before?
I wonder how did that happen? Any idea ?
Replaced and issue fixed

Just reminding you that not to recommend it to others without prior warning.
Actually I need that much only to keep tyres well within car body line.
Iam otherwise thinking to reduce and make it 1.25inch the very max
"Well, I have a sunfilm installed on front windshield, this will catch goat's attention more than 3inch wide track.

Actually Iam sucker for overall stance of car. I always like my car's tyres in line with the wheel arcs, not jutting out neither staying way inside, hence adding spacers."
"üòä

Technically 1.5 inches x 2 will increase 3 inches in your track length which is not suitable as per government norms."
"19inch in facelift Safari feels completely at home, maybe due to softened suspension than Harrier"
19inch a big nono. 18inch already feels stiff sometimes.
"1.5inch is negligible difference. Have been using same size on my ealier ecosport from last 6 years, no issues with anything. 
Though more than 2inch puts additonal load on hubs."
"Sir 
Go with 
245/55/19
OEM TATA ALLOYS
THIS WILL LOOK FAR BETTER WITH BEST RIDE QUALITY"
I prefer not use spacer as it will have negative impact due to change in fulcrum.
I might settle for 1.5inch spacers and continue using stock alloys.
18inch
What size you choose
Just realized how hard it is to find a good set of aftermarket alloys for Harrier. 5x108 pcd so darn rare
"Rat mainly approach your car for
1) food
2) shelter
3) warmness of the engine.

We are using rat repellent for avoiding 2&3."
Ok sir
"1) don't eat inside the car. 
2) don't put any kind of edible things inside the car.
3) wipe of all existing rat trials with a wet sanitizer tissue inside bonnet area. Make sure that there was no dirt in your tissue.
4) use 3m rat repellent spray.
5) do regular water washing focusing on wheel area and joints"

No. You can approach sc or showroom. Meanwhile check for any water leakage in that bent area. From the top.

"I have used a similar product ( different brand) for my previous car, and it worked well. However, I would recommend using it only for older cars, as it may make the shine and color appear dull on newer vehicles"

I was at petrol bunk and guy who was selling this product ....removed few completely from my dark edition
